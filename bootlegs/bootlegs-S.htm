        <p>I like the combination of the songs, and this CD
        sounds pretty powerful because it seems the bootleggers
        have added some reverb to a few songs (especially to <i>Back
        Door Man</i>). The disc comes with an unusual cover and
        my copy was only $10 at a regular record store. The CD
        lacks to mention the sources of the recordings on the
        cover. But if you read the informati- on above, you'll
        surely notice: Nothing spectacular, and they even cut the
        <i>Light My Fire</i> medley from Vancouver!<br>

        <p>The cover says <i>All tarcks</i> (sic) <i>written by
        Morrison/Manzarek/Densmore/Krieger</i>. Well, I don't
        really know what <i>tarcks</i> are, but the tracks were
        not all written by The Doors as everybody knows. Despite
        this silly mistake this CD is rather fine, although it is
        not the complete concert. Get <i>Jim's Alive - The
        Ultimate Seattle Tapes</i> (Tuff Bites 94.1009) and you
        know what I mean.<br>

        This CD has got a brilliant sound, I must admit. But if
        you have <i>Vancouver 70</i> (Skeleton SK 1066) or <i>Live
        In Vancouver</i> (Sounds Alive SA 24.020) and the great <i>Jim's
        Alive - The Ultimate Seattle Tapes</i> (Tuff Bites TB
        94.1009) you don't really need this Italian CD, although
        the sound is better on this one. Also - it is not the
        complete concert, and the Italians changed the original
        order of the songs. Needless to say they also cut off
        some of Jim's annotations between the songs.<br>

        <p>Although this box looks pretty nice, I think it is a
        must to avoid. First of all, it presents material most of
        you already have. Then, just check the sources - much of
        the material is presented twice in this box - those silly
        bootleggers didn't even notice they doubled many
        Vancouver and Seattle tracks! This means they didn't even
        listen to the tapes and CDs before they copied them for
        their release! The soundquality is much better on other
        releases. And the 20-page booklet that they call &quot;<i>The
        Doors - Instant Picture Book</i>&quot; has got nothing to
        do with The Doors at all, but shows Kennedy, Warhol,
        Martin Luther King, John Wayne (!) and others,
        accompanied by silly texts. The CDs have some of the same
        pictures as shown in the booklet (first time I see Pamela
        Courson, Morrison's girlfriend, on a CD). The tasteless
        cover of the box (Jim at the microphone with angel's
        wings on his back) should tell everybody: Keep your hands
        off! <b>Sneak away without buying this horror box</b>!<br>

        <p>Just another compilation of very well known material.
        Note that not all songs were performed <i>somewhere in
        America</i>. Those lazy bootleggers didn't even bother to
        name the sources of their material and give this excuse
        on the cover: &quot;<i>Only The Doors really know where</i>&quot;.
        Hmm, the Australian bootleggers probably knew everyone
        already had this material, so why not keep everybody
        guessing? The cover looks nice, though. But save your
        money for better stuff. The CD just says <i>Live Vol.1,
        America 1967</i>. A copy of this disc appeared with a

        <p><i><br>
        Definitely one of the most important compilation sets
        ever released. This absolutely interesting box contains
        superrare material never released on any other CD or
        vinyl. There's a whole bunch of great versions that were
        never ever heard before. I really enjoy the Break On
        Through</i> version from Amsterdam - with Ray Manzarek on
        vocals. Listen to the fantastic medley of <i>Gloria, Easy
        Ride</i> and <i>My Eyes Have Seen You</i>! <i>Someday
        Soon</i> is a real found! Definitely published for the
        first time - a different version than on those countless
        Seattle CDs - Jim misses one verse. Fine interview
        excerpts, by the way. The inclusion of two tracks from
        Dallas finishes a fine CD box nobody should miss. One
        word about the soundquality - there are a couple of songs
        that do not pass hifi-technology and high-end speakers,
        but who cares. At least there is 80% new unreleased
        material, and this definitely is what counts! <b>Recommended</b>!<br>

        <p>Another early classic live CD, which was widely
        distributed in Europe. It presents tracks from both
        Stockholm shows in excellent soundquality. Today it is a
        sought-after collectors' item, because Document Records
        do not exist anymore and there never was a reprint of
        this CD. Although <i>Live In Stockholm 1968</i> (The
        Swingin' Pig Records TSP-CD-004-2) is more popular, I
        prefer this because of its better soundquality and the
        great cover. <b>Recommended</b>.<br>

        <p>A perfect example how silly some of the bootleggers
        are. The instrumental <i>Summertime</i> from The Doors'
        Matrix performance is twice on this CD, the second time
        it got mislabeled as <i>No Limits No Laws</i>. <i>This
        Summer's Almost Gone</i> CD was copied from the Italian <i>Go
        Insane</i> double CD (Aulica Records A 112.10.1 and A
        112.10.2), on which a couple of songs got intentionally
        mislabelled, too. A rip off to fool fans! Keep your hands
        off this one! Truly a must to avoid.</p>
