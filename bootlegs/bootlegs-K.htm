        What a surprise for Doors- and Eddie Vedder- fans! Their
        rehearsal session plus the concert for their Rock'n'Roll
        Hall Of Fame Induction on one (Italian) CD. Good stereo
        quality, guys, although both are audience recordings
        (Seems there was a small audience at the rehearsal, you
        can hear somebody touching the mike, also clapping and
        cheers). The perfect CD for people who want to know how a
        band works with a new singer for the first (and only)
        time. False starts and ends here and there, and Robby and
        Ray are doing vocals on track 1-4. Robby still is a
        fascinating guitar player (just listen to his solos in <i>Roadhouse
        Blues</i>), and thanks to this unknown guy who taped the
        session some great Krieger-solos survived. Ray's keyboard
        actually sounds very much better than later at the
        concert! The concert itself is presented in very good
        quality, too, although the three songs were better
        performed during the rehearsal. <b>Recommended</b>,
        although Eddie should have learned the lyrics more
        precisely. I still cannot believe that there are people
        out there who want Vedder to join a Doors reunion as
        their singer!<br>

        <p>This is one of the worst compilations ever! As I've
        told you guys before - keep your hands off a CD featuring
        tracks labeled as <i>New Orleans 1970</i> or entitled <i>Let
        It Bleed</i> or any of the other rubbish. And the sound
        of some tracks is horribly bad! We all know where the
        bootlegger copied the songs from, and we know it is our
        damn duty to ignore those kinds of CDs. The cover booklet
        has 4 photos of Morrison taken by Herve Muller, the back
        shows a Morrison portrait taken by Frank Lisciandro. I
        guess these photographers wouldn't mind their precious
        photos on a record cover, but on such a bad bootleg CD
        like this? <i>The Killer Awoke</i> is nothing else but a
        waste of plastic!<br>

        <p>The quality of both CDs is bad compared to other
        releases, but I enjoy the nice hardcover fold-out
        longbox, which shows two beautiful Morrison photos. I'm
        sure people will buy it because the cover which says the
        tracks were from Westbury, but this is not true. The
        bootleggers want to make people think this was an
        unpublished recording, but the tracks are available on
        many other releases. So this tremendously looking box is
        just another intentionally mislabeled rip off.</p>
