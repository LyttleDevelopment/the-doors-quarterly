        <p>A widely distributed copy of The Doors featuring
        Albert King - Feel The Blues (American Concert Series ACS
        024, Italy 1992), amazingly enough there are much better
        bootlegs of this concert around (for example Tuff Bites'
        One Hundred Minutes), but they used that fade-in,
        fade-out version that nobody liked. To my surprise this
        CD is available at amazon.com in the USA; they probably
        did not realise this was a bootleg. The cover shows Val
        Kilmer as Jim Morrison and the design is not bad at all,
        but - huh - the sound is awful!<br>

        <p>Another compilation CD, for the first time from

        better quality, this compilation should be considered as
        not worth to be considered seriously. Talking about the

        awful one. And the title of the CD (<i>Jim Morrison's

        <p><i><br>
        &quot;Remember Miami&quot;</i>, somebody shouts from the
        audience. <i>&quot;What was that?&quot;</i> Jim asks,
        because he did not get what the girl had shouted. But
        nobody responds. Instead of that, squeaking noises from
        Ray's keyboard bother Jim. <i>&quot;That's a terrible
        sound&quot;</i>, he says. What a horrible start for one
        of the worst Doors concerts ever taped. Now on this
        European bootleg you can hear the entire show in
        excellent stereo quality, just Light My Fire is missed,
        they say this song was not taped by Vince Treanor, former
        Doors roadmanager, who recorded the show. Jim sounds
        tired, not to say bored; his singing is sloppy. <i>&quot;Get
        the singer some&quot;</i>, he says after <i>Back Door Man</i>
        as an excuse, and also: <i>&quot;Thank you for your
        patience, you know, it takes a ... - it takes a few songs
        to get warmed up, you know what I'm talking about?
        Alright!&quot;</i> Jim was aware of the fact this would
        be a concert people could have easily missed. Talking
        about bad versions: <i>When The Music's Over</i> from
        Seattle is probably the worst version of the song that
        ever came out on bootleg. I do not mean all the feedback
        coming through the speakers, but Jim Morrison himself,
        who seems to be at his worst during that particular song.
        His imitating of guitar- and mike-feedback with his
        voice, which (for the audience) is more or less just
        boring, is painfully ridiculous. But Jim gets some
        applause for all those funny noises. What an audience!
        And the other three Doors should have hidden Jim's
        maracas, if you know what I mean: just listen to his
        rhythm. Twenty minutes of nothing but embarrassment. But
        on this CD you'll find the <b>complete</b> version of <i>Someday
        Soon</i>, with all the guitar chords at the beginning
        plus the long ending. The 28-minute-version (!) of <i>Mystery
        Train</i> will blow your mind away. This jam definitely
        is absolutely worth buying this CD and features nice
        covers of Curtis Mayfield's <i>People Get Ready</i> (have
        you heard Rod Stewart's soap version?), <i>Baby Please
        Don't Go</i> (an Animals classic) and also Robert
        Johnson's Crossroads. <i>Five To One</i> is somewhat
        uninspired, and if there wasn't Ray's organ, <i>Break On
        Through</i> would be a very boring song. The liner notes
        talk about previous versions of the Seattle concert
        having two songs from The Doors' Toronto Show on, and it
        was the complete show minus <i>Light My Fire</i>. The
        bootlegger is right, except the fact that those two songs
        on the other boots were from Vancouver. On <i>Jim's Alive
        - The Ultimative Seattle Tapes</i> you have the <b>right</b>
        tracks.<br>
        Okay, people, here's a Doors concert with some
        highlights, but also bad versions. The soundquality is
        perfect stereo, and the CD is 78 minutes (!!!) long. <b>Recommended</b>
        and a definitive must for each collection, not only for
        the songs but definitely for the fine cover, too!</p>
