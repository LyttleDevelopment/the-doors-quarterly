        Anniversary of a classic. A retro review.<br>
        1985 - 2020.<br>
        Live Aid - COVID-19.<br>
        Two cornerstones in recent history everyone old enough
        will remember and never forget.<br>
        This to illustrate how long this album has been around
        for...<br>
        <br>
        For my 10th Birthday, in 1986, my old elementary school
        friend was going to buy me a present. &quot;Are there any
        Doors records you don't own yet?&quot;.<br>
        I'll never forget the playground conversation that day. I
        refused, he insisted... I didn't really need this, and I
        told my friend so, because by this<br>
        time I had collected most of the albums and there was
        nothing new on it... Nevertheless, needless to say, I was
        blown away and over the moon<br>
        by his gesture. It's in my collection still, and meets up
        with my record player every now and again.<br>
        <br>
        A bit of an oddball perhaps in the world of all things
        Greatest Hits, Best Of, Platinum Collection, Archives and
        so on. The world of compilation albums.<br>
        &quot;The Doors Classics&quot; is not about the chart
        topping hits, neither does it focus on what the public at
        large would tag as the best songs, or the best known<br>
        ones for that matter. Not a career overview and no
        collection of rarities... There's no concept at all
        really. These are classic songs by a classic band,<br>
        final stop. Pointless? Perhaps so, especially in our
        modern day and age where everything's online and up for
        grabs on YouTube, Spotify, Amazon et al.<br>
        We need to go back to 1985 to understand why the record
        company felt the need for this.<br>
        <br>
        The 1980s had started with a huge renewed interest in the
        Doors, with the inclusion of &quot;The End&quot; in the
        movie &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; by Francis Ford<br>
        Coppola. And then there was the first ever Jim Morrison
        biography: &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, by
        Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman.<br>
        Followed shortly by the Doors' debut home video, &quot;A
        Tribute to Jim Morrison&quot;. Suddenly the band appeared
        to be more popular and in higher<br>
        demand than ever before. Added to this successful wave
        was the 1980 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation,
        succeeded by a first opening of the vaults<br>
        with 1983's &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot;. Both did very
        well on the charts. Two years later, mid decade, with
        interest in the Doors perhaps declining a bit,<br>
        Elektra Records was not about to let their initial
        flagship slip into oblivion. Hence a second home video
        release, &quot;Dance On Fire&quot;, and indeed,<br>
        &quot;The Doors Classics&quot;.<br>
        <br>
        So far never released on CD officially, &quot;The Doors
        Classics&quot; stands as an interesting selection of both
        the best and the greatest,<br>
        mixed with some high end deep cuts. So here's the
        tracklisting. It's easy and fun to pour the songs into a
        Spotify playlist for example,<br>
        to get the feel and flow of this longplayer. The featured
        &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, by the way, is the well
        known and much used live version<br>
        that first appeared on &quot;An American Prayer&quot;,
        later on &quot;The Doors In Concert&quot;, and so on...<br>

        Note the absence of hits like &quot;Light My Fire&quot;
        and &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;, and of further
        compilation standards like &quot;The End&quot;.<br>
        Unusual indeed.<br>
