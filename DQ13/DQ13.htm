        size="3" face="Calibri">Again, we move back into the past
        with The Doors Quarterly Magazine #13, which was sent to
        our readers on March 13, 1987 ...<br>
        Yes yes, that's 33 years ago, and at the time of writing
        this new intro, we're nearing the end of this awful
        Corona year 2020 ...<br>
        <br>
        Let me guide you through one of the last copies of DQ13
        to have survived. Anyway, it was part of the early
        Quarterlies that got xeroxed only.<br>
        This issue had its intro written in English, because more
        and more fans from countries all over the world had
        become subscribers.<br>
        <br>
        For preparing this DQ 13, no computer or Internet, let
        alone emails and quick whatsapp services were available.<br>
        Everything got typed on my old and heavy electric
        typewriter and the bigger letters for headings used to be
        pretty expensive rub-off letters<br>
        on small plastic sheets or plastic lettering tapes. Those
        were the days - slow post office services and incredibly
        expensive phone calls<br>
        to fans in foreign countries used to be the only way to
        communicate and get information for a new DQ in the
        works.<br>
        <br>
        Let's check what's in this issue:<br>
        For the intro Danny Sugerman wrote something pointing to
        those fans vandalizing Jim's grave, destroying the peace
        it deserves.<br>
        Danny was asking people to show respect. That wish
        unfortunately never did come true, just remember the riot
        on July 3rd 1991.<br>
        For a visual history of the grave, check the wonderful
        &quot;Visual history of Jim
        Morrison&#146;s&nbsp;grave&quot; website here: <br>

        href="https://parismojo.fr/visual-history-of-jim-morrisons-grave/"
        target="new"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"

        Fine news following - &quot;Live at the Hollywood
        Bowl&quot; EP and video were announced, and poetry from
        the &quot;127 Fascination Box&quot;<br>
        plus poems by Jim written in Paris were about to be
        published by The Doors (source: Ray Manzarek) ...
        Newspaper clips about the box are<br>
        reprinted in this DQ in their entirety. An article by
        Thomas Collmer on &quot;Five to One&quot; plus Part Two
        of &quot;The Morrison Mirage&quot; written by<br>
        Michael Horowitz for Crawdaddy magazine in 1969 are next.
        Truly interesting. So is an interview by John Tobler with
        the three<br>
        surviving Doors called &quot;The Doors in a Nutshell - 64
        Quick Questions&quot;, done for Zig Zag Magazine in 1972.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;Bootlegging The Doors&quot; follows and sheds some
        light on different pressings of illegal Doors LPs, this
        time the super rare &quot;Kralingen&quot; bootleg,<br>
        which had songs from the Isle of Wight on it, plus the
        famous &quot;Moonlight Drive - The Scream of the
        Butterfly Live at the Matrix 1967&quot; disc.<br>
        I did my best to find out more about the many different
        pressings of this bootleg. How do I know all that? Well,
        when buying a record like this,<br>
        I always talked to the seller to find out more. By the
        way, I bought my first copy of &quot;Moonlight
        Drive&quot; in 1974 at the Amsterdam flea market,<br>
        and I was told by the guy who owned the stall that he had
        acquired a couple of copies just the week before.<br>
        <br>
        Robby Krieger spoke to Harvey Perr on May 6, 1970 ...
        this interview never saw the light of day in a magazine -
        until I got a transcript of the<br>
        interview and added it to DQ 13. And, what's so
        interesting about The Doors / The Stranglers? Find out
        for yourselves in an article called<br>
        &quot;The Doors Connection&quot;. 4 pages of letters from
        fans and an interview with Frank Lisciandro by Antoine
        Légat mostly about the<br>
        &quot;An American Prayer&quot; LP finish this DQ 13.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">A free
        poster was added to this DQ, but honestly I forgot which
        one.<br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version
        of DQ 12.<br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">And
        don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 13 hasn't been altered in any way.<br>
        You get it as it was published in March 1987 (!). Be
        aware that all addresses (private, phone including my own
        address in this issue on page 2)<br>
        are certainly no longer valid anymore. Books, vinyl
        records, CDs and other stuff might not be available
        anymore.<br>
        Please do not respond to any of the small ads or blame
        anyone for incorrect details or typos - all writers just
        did the best they could do back<br>
        at the beginning of Spring in 1987. And all this happened
        without any computers, without any emails and of course
        without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 13 I have to tell
        you that<br>
        unfortunately there are absolutely no copies left at all!<br>
        <br>
        Thank you!<br>
