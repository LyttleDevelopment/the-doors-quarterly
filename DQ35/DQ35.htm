        Quarterly Magazine No 35, complete, without any changes,<br>
        as it got published and sent out to all fanclub members
        on June 30, 1997.<br>
        It didn't just feature some news and points for
        discussion, but also very interesting<br>
        articles, for example Hervé Luxardo's &quot;Jim Morrison
        and Dionysos,&quot; some newspaper<br>
        clips about the Miami trial, part 4 of The Miami
        testimonies (in this issue: Ray Manzarek)<br>
        and not to forget the interesting story of the
        &quot;Stoned but Articulate&quot; tapes.</font><p><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">22 CD reviews
        (including the -still- phantastic &quot;Stages&quot;
        4-CD-box) and a couple of rare<br>
        photos (Jim singing while Ray Manzarek is playing the
        drums in Frankfurt, a beautiful<br>
        photo of Jac Holzman holding my &quot;Doors&quot; book in
        his arms, and a superb picture of<br>
        Danny Sugerman's copy of &quot;The Lords - Notes on
        Vision) made quite a good<br>
        magazine, right? It came along with a free poster, btw.</font></p>
