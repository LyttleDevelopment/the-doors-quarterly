        size="3" face="Calibri">Back into the past with The Doors
        Quarterly Magazine #15, which got published on September
        12, 1987.<br>
        More than 32 years ago ... Making it even harder to
        remember correctly what was going on at the time.<br>
        So let's check this issue of The Doors Quarterly Magazine
        for some more retro Doors news!<br>
        <br>
        The finest news of all: the original release of the
        &quot;Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; film on VHS video
        cassette,<br>
        as well as its soundtrack on LP and audio cassette - and
        CD, the relative new format in those days.<br>
        At that time we already noticed that &quot;Hello I Love
        You&quot; was missing, and that but half of &quot;Spanish
        Caravan&quot; got<br>
        featured. Very unfortunate! This was also noted in three
        US newspaper clips, added on pages 12 and 13.<br>
        Today, we all know better and are happy to own a complete
        version of the concert.<br>
        Although a few things in &quot;Live at the Bowl '68&quot;
        (2012) are still not quite right, with audio snippets
        from other<br>
        sources blended in to even the technical issues. Check
        the internet for more info on this.<br>
        <br>
        I was delighted to feature Sybille's &quot;Astrological
        Portrait of Jim Morrison&quot; in DQ 15. I haven't read
        it in quite a<br>
        while but it reminds me of some nice times spent together
        with Sybille in Munich and in Los Angeles, years later.<br>
        Especially during the &quot;Night of the Guitars&quot;
        tour in May of 1989.<br>
        <br>
        Check Danny Sugerman's letter to the DQ, presenting his
        point of view on the book &quot;No One Here Gets Out
        Alive&quot;.<br>
        It's pretty interesting what he had to say. <br>
        So is Patricia Kennealy, talking about her relationship
        with Jim on pages 36-42 (from &quot;Rock Wives&quot;,
        Virgin Books 1986).<br>
        <br>
        On pages 24-29 there's an article on Craig Strete's
        &quot;Uns verbrennt die Nacht&quot; (Burn Down the
        Night), unmasking all<br>
        the lies Strete used in order to make his story sound
        real. Sorry, this article is available in German language
        only.<br>
        <br>
        With the help of my article &quot;Bootlegging the
        Doors&quot; it will be easy to check which pressing of
        the famous double vinyl<br>
        bootleg &quot;Resurrection&quot; you may own (pages
        31-35).<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ 15 there was no computer around -
        everything got typed on my ancient electric typewriter.<br>
        The larger letters for headings used to be rub-off
        letters on small plastic sheets or plastic lettering
        tapes.<br>
        There was a free black and white poster with it, of Jim
        and Pamela among some other people at Themis Boutique.<br>
        The cover of DQ 15 got printed professionally, but its
        content just got xeroxed...<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ...<br>
        We will continue soon by publishing a digital version of
        DQ 14. <br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 15 hasn't been altered in any way.<br>
        You get it as it was published in September 1987 (!). Be
        aware that all addresses and phone numbers (including<br>
        my own on page 3 of this issue) are certainly no longer
        valid any longer. Books, vinyl records, CDs and other
        stuff<br>
        might not be available anymore. Please do not respond to
        any of the small ads or blame anyone<br>
        for incorrect details - all writers just did the best
        they could back in 1987.<br>
        And all this happened without any computer, without any
        emails and of course without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of the Doors Quarterly Magazine 15 I have to tell
        you that<br>
        unfortunately there are no copies left at all!<br>
        Thank you!<br>
