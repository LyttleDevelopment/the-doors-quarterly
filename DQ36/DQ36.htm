        is here in its digital format, free for all to download<br>
        and enjoy! Please note that your digital copy of The

        been altered in any way. You get it as it was published
        on June 5, 1998. Be aware that<br>

        respond to any of the small<br>
        ads or blame anyone for incorrect details - all writers
        just did the best they<br>
        could back in 1998.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF"
        size="3" face="Calibri">Enjoy and let us know what you
        think ...</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Somehow
        I realize by now that on the cover of this 1998 issue
        there are the two<br>
        members of The Doors who are still alive in 2013 ...</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Scanning
        through the pages, lovely memories returned. I had
        watched Gilla Cremer's<br>
        one-woman theatre play and was amazed how incredibly
        impressive it had been.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Best
        thing of all in 1997 was the reunion of Robby Krieger and
        John Densmore for a<br>
        couple of European concerts. John had jumped in for Ray
        Manzarek, who was<br>
        suffering gastric ulcer problems and had to stay in
        hospital. I had time to attend<br>
        some of their performances, be backstage and see them at
        their hotels.<br>
        Needless to say, I took a lot of photos.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">1997 and
        1998 were the peak years for bootleggers, incredibly many
        CDs came out,<br>
        find 15 CD releases in DQ 36.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">And
        enjoy the colour photos - that made the issue pretty
        expensive!</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">PS ...
