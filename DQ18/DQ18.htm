        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #18
        was published in the nice summer of 1988, right before my
        trip to the island of Corfu (Greece)<br>
        and right after my visit to L.A. where I had met
        everybody I wanted to meet (well, except for Ray
        Manzarek, who was busy and<br>
        feared to answer &quot;a lot of tricky Doors
        questions&quot;, as I was told by Sugerman). I had a
        great time in L.A., staying at Danny's house<br>
        for a couple of days, after which I had the pleasure of
        residing in Jim's room at the Alta Cienega Motel for 10
        days (still grateful<br>
        that The Doors paid for my stay there).<br>
        <br>
        Of course the idea of writing an L.A. guide for Doors
        fans was born there. Danny liked the idea and took me to
        a few sites including<br>
        an Italian restaurant where we met John Densmore for an
        interview. My friend Jeannie Cromie showed me around, and
        Linda Kyriazi<br>
        (Robby's manager) was very helpful as well and she
        arranged a meeting with Robby. Just read my intro on
        pages 2 and 3 of this DQ.<br>
        You'll also see a photo of me holding the original reel
        for 'Hello I Love You' from German TV which I got for The
        Doors right before<br>
        mailing it to Sugerman's office. <br>
        <br>
        The news speaks for itself: The Doors Quarterly (at that
        time there was no internet, no email, no WhatsApp, no
        Facebook or whatever)<br>
        was always first in reporting the fans - I'm still pretty
        proud of that! You can't imagine how hard it used to be
        collecting all the news<br>
        (although my letterbox got stuffed every day and my phone
        bill got higher and higher; no flat-rate tariff of any
        kind at the time).<br>
        <br>
        Check Scott Hyder's article 'Passages of a Poet and a
        Puer'. I still enjoy Scott's symbolic study, written
        exclusively for DQ.<br>
        <br>
        There are three reviews of bootleg albums, which are
        incredibly rare nowadays. Most interesting, &quot;If It
        Ain't One Thing It's Another&quot;,<br>
        offering a pretty good recording of the first Dallas
        show; December 11, 1970. A couple of bootleg CDs follow,
        the finest one<br>
        probably being &quot;The Stockholm Tapes&quot;, published
        by Document Records.<br>
        <br>
        Needless to say, I wrote an article about spending an
        afternoon with Robby Krieger, and I still cherish the
        interview video tape of<br>
        that day. Does anyone own a recording of the comedy show
        called &quot;The Black Beatles&quot; that Robby played
        for me in his living room?<br>
        <br>
        An article in German is next: &quot;Shaman's Blues&quot;.
        I wish somebody would translate this truly interesting
        thing about shamanism and<br>
        druids featured in Jim Morrison's poetry.<br>
        <br>
        Next, an open letter from Danny Sugerman to the readers
        of The Doors Quarterly Magazine, presenting us with an
        unpublished<br>
        excerpt from his book, &quot;Wonderland Avenue&quot;,
        edited out of the final printed version. Exclusively
        published in The Doors Quarterly<br>
        Magazine by kind permission of the author.<br>
        <br>
        Part two of the famous John Densmore phone interview by
        Australia's Billy Pinnell covers the early days of The
        Doors, followed<br>
        by a German report on 'The Phantom' - I still enjoy
        &quot;Calm Before The Storm&quot; and &quot;Half A
        Life&quot; a lot, they both are great songs!<br>
        Last but not least: a rare Jim Morrison poem entitled
        &quot;Sounds For Your Soul&quot;, originally printed in
        the 1968 Doors tour book.<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ there was no computer around -
        everything got typed on my ancient electric typewriter
        and the bigger<br>
        letters for headings used to be rub-off letters on small
        plastic sheets or plastic lettering tapes.<br>
        A free poster came with the magazine, but I forgot which
        one of the about 20 different posters available I used
        for DQ 18.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by digitising DQ 17.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 18 hasn't been altered in any way. You get it as
        it was<br>
        published in the summer of 1988 (!). Be aware that all
        addresses (private, phone) are certainly no longer valid.
        Books, records,<br>
        CDs and other stuff might not be available any longer.
        Please do not respond to any of the small ads or blame
        anyone for<br>
        incorrect details - all writers just did the best they
        could do back in early 1988.<br>
        And all this happened without any computer, any emails
        and of course without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this issue I must tell you that there are no
        copies left at all!<br>
        Thank you!<br>
