        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #17
        got published on April 14th, 1988. The envelopes I sent
        the magazines in all had a little<br>
        sensation pasted onto them: the one and only Jim Morrison
        stamp, published on the very day of this DQ's release in
        Germany.<br>
        Could any surprise have been any better for the readers
        of the DQ?<br>
        <br>
        I wonder how many of you guys still have your envelopes -
        I've kept the ones that came back from subscribers who
        forgot to tell<br>
        me their new address; I still have a full sheet of 25
        stamps framed on my wall. Many years later I got a call
        from Paul Rothchild,<br>
        asking for a sheet of stamps for his collection, and
        thanks to some fortunate circumstances I was able to get
        him one.<br>
        By the way, 20.000.000 stamps got printed by the
        &quot;Deutsche Bundespost&quot; ... <br>
        Because of the stamps (they cost much more than the usual
        postage for mailing a DQ) there was no money left for the
        usual<br>
        free poster, so I added a previously issued poster to the
        magazines.<br>
        <br>
        You'll find all news of these old days on pages 4 &amp; 5
        in this DQ, and I could not resist to tell readers about
        the invitation I had<br>
        received from Danny Sugerman and Ray Manzarek, to come to
        Los Angeles in June 1988 and do a &quot;grand tour of
        L.A.&quot; together<br>
        with them, as Sugerman put it in his letter.<br>
        <br>
        The main article of this DQ is Scott Hyder's fine
        symbolic study Part 2, which was originally written for
        the C.G. Jung Institute<br>
        (in Zurich, Switzerland - if I remember well).<br>
        <br>
        After the bits on new vinyl bootlegs (most of them
        useless, yet collector's items nowadays) you'll find a
        short German article<br>
        written by Ulrich Heumann, one of the nicest Doors fans I
        have ever met. Unfortunately he passed away in June 2014.<br>
        I miss you, Ulrich!<br>
        <br>
        Then there's a fascinating article written for LIFE
        magazine in April 1968 by Fred Powledge, about the
        importance of The<br>
        Doors, and additionally it mainly concentrates on the
        infamous New Haven incident.<br>
        <br>
        Among a few more fine articles there's an interview with
        Ray Manzarek from British SOUNDS magazine, December 1973:<br>
        &quot;And then the damn fool goes and dies; I don't know
        how he pulled that one off&quot;, mostly about Ray's
        activities after the<br>
        break-up of the group.<br>
        <br>
        And -last but not least- thanks to Patricia Devaux for
        the fine photo of the famous bust on Jim's grave (before
        it got vandalised).<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ 17 there was no computer around -
        everything got typed on my ancient electric typewriter
        and the bigger<br>
        letters for headings used to be rub-off letters on small
        plastic sheets or plastic lettering tapes.<br>
        There was a free (old) poster with it, but I forgot which
        one of the about 20 different DQ posters available I used
        for DQ 17.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version
        of DQ 16.<br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 17 hasn't been altered in any way. You get it as
        it was<br>
        published in April 1988 (!). Be aware that all addresses
        (private, phone) are certainly no longer valid. Books,
        vinyl records,<br>
        CDs and other stuff might not be available anymore.
        Please do not respond to any of the small ads or blame
        anyone for<br>
        incorrect details - all writers just did the best they
        could do back in early 1988. And all this happened
        without any computer,<br>
        any emails and of course without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 17 I have to tell
        you that<br>
        unfortunately there are no copies left at all!<br>
        Thank you!<br>
