        face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine # 32, issued
        on June 15, 1995 &#150; what can I say?<br>
        What a fine issue it was!<br>
        <br>
        It was almost 20 years ago today, when the readers of DQ
        Magazine found out about<br>
        Paul Rothchild&#146;s sudden death, right after he had
        finished work on digitally remastering<br>
        the An American Prayer CD. I paid my tribute to him by
        reprinting his (basic) interview<br>
        he did for L.A.&#146;s BAM magazine.<br>
        <br>
        And there&#146;s the transcript of Jim&#146;s Jomo &amp;
        The Smoothies session (as reviewed in my usual<br>
        Notes From The Underground, The Lost Paris Tapes, check
        page 20/21 of DQ 32).<br>
        It took a lot of work to review that many underground
        releases and of course all<br>
        those official publications, tell ya!<br>
        <br>
        Another transcript should be read while listening to a
        recording of The Doors'<br>
        infamous Miami concert (March 1, 1969) &#150; the article
        called Apocalypse Now, Then (p. 34-45),<br>
        which is a chapter in my Doors book by Heel Publishers,
        here translated into English<br>
        for the first time ever.<br>
        <br>
        Most fascinating of all are two of Jim Morrison&#146;s
        testimonies transcribed by a court reporter,<br>
        dated September 16 and September 17, 1970. They make a
        damn interesting reading,<br>
        check yourself!<br>
        <br>
        For our German readers Gabriele Pagel examined two books
        containing different translations<br>
        of Morrison&#146;s poetry into German language (p.69-73).
        It is a very strange trip through<br>
        a whole lotta awful mistakes made by the people who
        translated Jim&#146;s poems,<br>
        and I still would like to hear comments about
        Gabriele&#146;s article from our German readers.<br>
        Somehow I wonder why those books are still around and why
        readers still take those<br>
        translations for granted.<br>
        <br>
        A photo of The Doors&#146; Dutch release of The Soft
        Parade is on the title page, and one of<br>
        the German special release of Waiting For The Sun is on
        page75 --- both vinyl discs are<br>
        rare collector&#146;s items with increasing value.<br>
        <br>
        And &#150; check page 29 &#150; Ray Manzarek confirmed to
        me that the song Take It As It Comes<br>
        was written by Robby Krieger, and he let me print the
        according document, which he<br>
        announced being authentic.<br>
        <br>
        Have fun (re-)reading The Doors Quarterly #32.<br>

        but with two<br>
        Doors bumper stickers for a change.<br>

        <br>
