                                There appears to be a new wave of vinyl record and CD
                                publishing companies<br>
                                releasing material that hasn't found its way out via
                                artists' official sources.<br>
                                Plural, because Broadcasting Radio Records are a busy
                                lot, putting out stuff by<br>
                                a wide variety of artists. And in that, BRR isn't the
                                sole label these days so<br>
                                there is quite a bit going on.<br>

                                Seattle, June 5th 1970 wasn't a very good night for the
                                Doors. In fact it was a<br>
                                pretty bad show, disastrous even when compared to some of
                                the outstanding<br>
                                concerts they had produced earlier on that year. Yet this
                                doesn't stop bootleggers<br>
                                and publishers of semi legal albums from revisiting the
                                concert - read: from<br>
                                making easy money on it - time and time again. Not
                                surprisingly of course.<br>
                                The legend and popularity of the Doors lives on, and with
                                each new generation<br>
                                of fans comes the need for more than what Elektra and
                                Rhino have been and<br>
                                are giving us.<br>
                                <br>
                                This release though is by all means best avoided, and we
                                strongly recommend<br>
                                an old bootleg CD of this show instead. At the time of
                                writing of course, it's<br>
                                summer 2016 and hopes are high for this below the
                                standards Doors concert to<br>
                                find a release that will surpass all existing
                                publications in both content and quality<br>
                                of sound, because none of them have yet offered the
                                concert in its entirety. Both<br>
                                'Light My Fire' and encore 'The End', abruptly terminated
                                before completion by<br>

                                yet - I should add<br>
                                that they are assumed to have never been recorded by at
                                the time road<br>
                                manager, Vince Treanor; but you never know...<br>
                                <br>
                                Perhaps the biggest issue about this release is the
                                absence of the song that<br>
                                makes the concert an interesting one despite its flaws:
                                'Someday Soon'. A rare<br>
                                one in the Doors catalogue, never tried for in the
                                studio, performed in concert a<br>
                                handful of times only. It is a mere assumption rather
                                than a fact, but the reason for<br>
                                this is quite obvious: the track has been published
                                officially by Elektra Records and<br>
                                is therefore properly copyright protected; check your
                                copy of the 1997 'Box Set'.<br>
                                <br>
                                Most probably a copy of 'Jim's Alive - The Ultimate
                                Seattle Tapes' (Tuff Bites, 1994),<br>
                                this CD / double album could have made for a difference
                                twenty years after that<br>
                                rare CD with its remarkable cartoon cover (a Tuff Bites
                                trademark, by the way) but<br>
                                in that it has failed. &quot;For completists only&quot;,
                                this would be the verdict of a long time<br>
                                collector. &quot;Good to have&quot;, in case owning or
                                acquiring a copy of the Tuff Bites disc<br>
                                is not an option. But you will find yourselves listening
                                more often to 'Someday Soon'<br>
                                which ironically isn't on the album than to the rest of
                                this show which wouldn't have<br>
                                been a great loss had it not been recorded. But: it's
                                Doors history, people! And more<br>
                                so than any other taped concert, Seattle 1970 reveals a
                                hard working quartet of<br>
                                men - of humans, having an off day.<br>
