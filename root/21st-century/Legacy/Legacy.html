                            </em><br>
                            Twenty years ago this Summer, fans of the Doors found
                            their way to the local music outlet, others sought for
                            the novelty<br>
                            online. News had been doing the rounds recently, the air
                            was buzzing with anticipation.<br>
                            <br>
                            Bookended by two further compilation albums, 2000's
                            &quot;The Best of the Doors&quot; and 2007's &quot;The
                            Very Best of the Doors&quot;,<br>
                            &quot;Legacy: The Absolute Best&quot; surfaced as another
                            redundant release by the Doors and Elektra / Rhino. At
                            least it<br>
                            wasn't flying under the banner of 'best of' or 'greatest
                            hits' - there had been more than enough of those
                            already...<br>
                            <br>
                            In 2003, surfing the wave of archival material released
                            by the band's own Bright Midnight label, at the time
                            there was<br>
                            little need for this upteenth collection of the all too
                            standard, of the well known... A well chosen selection of
                            songs<br>
                            spanning the six studio albums with Jim, plus &quot;Gloria&quot;
                            from &quot;Alive She Cried&quot; (1983). A more than
                            decent introduction to,<br>
                            indeed, the legacy of the Doors, for fresh ears.<br>
                            <br>
                            So what's up for grabs? Admittingly very well designed,
                            this 2CD set, with several photographs sourcing from the
                            rather<br>
                            rare side of things, even for seasoned Doors fans - at
                            the time. That's the eyes covered, but what exactly is in
                            there<br>
                            to treat our ears with? Nothing much of special interest?
                            Well, maybe...<br>
                            <br>
                            Worth mentioning is the inclusion of the then still fresh
                            uncensored mixes of both &quot;Break on Through&quot; and
                            &quot;The End&quot; - I<br>
                            doubt anyone reading this here today would have no idea
                            what I'm on about. For those already owning the 1999<br>
                            box set &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; at the
                            time, these were anything but a novelty.<br>
                            <br>
                            But there was one piece of bait interesting enough for
                            many to bite and cash in anyway. &quot;Legacy&quot; was
                            graced by an eye<br>
                            opening hype sticker, proudly announcing a previously
                            unreleased track... The one track fans had been waiting
                            for<br>
                            for many years, well knowing it was out there, with band
                            management and record company well knowing<br>
                            the demand for it was high. It was nothing less than the
                            fabled studion version of &quot;The Celebration of the
                            Lizard&quot;.<br>
                            <br>
                            Due for inclusion on the band's third album &quot;Waiting
                            for the Sun&quot; in 1968, the epic piece in the end was
                            featured only in<br>
                            printed text on the inside of the gatefold album sleeve.
                            &quot;Celebration&quot; was abandoned when the band and
                            producer Paul A.<br>
                            Rothchild realised it was going nowhere, they just
                            couldn't get it right in a studio setting. Famously, the
                            band had to quickly<br>
                            come up with more material to compromise the loss, to
                            fill up side B of the record that was to reserved for
                            &quot;Celebration&quot;.<br>
                            Back to the drawing board, back to former ideas and back
                            to the early demo tapes.<br>
                            <br>
                            One chapter of &quot;Celebration&quot; did go down well
                            and found it's way onto the album, rightfully. The
                            classic &quot;Not to Touch the<br>
                            Earth&quot;... A belter! The song truly sits among the
                            strongest moments of the album and ranks among the Doors'
                            all time<br>
                            greatest achievements; in my humble opinon it does.<br>
                            <br>
                            Over the following two years the Doors would continue to
                            work on &quot;Celebration&quot; and its individual
                            chapters in concert,<br>
                            resulting in its maiden appearance on &quot;Absolutely
                            Live&quot; in the Summer of 1970 - recorded at the Los
                            Angeles Aquarius<br>
                            Theatre, the previous year.<br>
                            <br>
                            The work in progress aura of the take featured on &quot;Legacy&quot;
                            may be for completists only, for the fan who wants to
                            hear<br>
                            everything. Understanding this was the ultimate studio
                            effort, the decission to leave it be was pretty
                            straightforward.<br>
                            On the other hand, it is without a doubt a unique and
                            very important piece of Doors history. Listening today,
                            20 years<br>
                            after the initial release and revisiting for the first
                            time in many years, I am pleasantly surprised though.<br>
                            <br>
                            Here's a brief breakdown...<br>
                            <br>
                            Kicking off with an air of tuning and getting ready to
                            go, the very start reminds me of &quot;Rock is Dead&quot;
                            in a way. The sound<br>
                            of the Doors warming up... &quot;Lions in the Street&quot;
                            is pretty messy, not much cohesion happening there.
                            &quot;Wake Up&quot; and &quot;A<br>
                            Little Game&quot; on the other hand appear in a further
                            progressed state. So does &quot;The Hill Dwellers&quot;,
                            yielding John<br>
                            Densmore's fantastic percussion work, very different from
                            anything we've heard before - I love it!<br>
                            <br>
                            The included runthrough of &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot;
                            is close to breathtaking, it's a most wonderful outtake!
                            This time it's<br>
                            Robby shining with an unfamiliar guitar solo during the
                            middle section. Further variations in tone and tempo make
                            for an<br>
                            incredible listening experience.<br>
                            <br>
                            &quot;Names of the Kingdom&quot; needed polishing still,
                            and the closing chapter &quot;The Palace of Exile&quot;
                            is missing. Bar a couple of lines<br>
                            from Jim, wrapping up the with a haunting vocal.
                            Goosebumps alert!<br>
                            <br>
                            &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; in this here
                            perception was later repeated on the &quot;Perception&quot;
                            box set, as well as on the 40th<br>
                            Anniversary CD version of &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;.<br>
                            <br>
                            So thank you for this, something that had been in
                            anticipation for way too long. It's just a bit of a shame
                            the decision was<br>
                            made to devote the goodie to a set that hardly a soul
                            would have turned their hard earned attention (read:
                            money) to<br>
                            otherwise. Well, it wasn't the first time, and it sure a
                            hell would not be the last either!<br>

                            &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot; was left off a

                            slipcase does list the track, yet the<br>
