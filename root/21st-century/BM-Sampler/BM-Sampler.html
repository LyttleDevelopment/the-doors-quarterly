                                I remember an article in the local newspaper, advertising
                                that the Doors<br>
                                were to establish an own subsidiary publishing label, to
                                dive into the<br>
                                vaults and to pull out all existing material that had
                                been left untouched<br>
                                for decades... I was both thrilled and held back,
                                probably bordering<br>
                                suspicion even. Why that is, I will explain after the
                                following bit of<br>
                                history, or rather the misplaced irony thereof.<br>
                                <br>
                                What we -Rainer and myself- have been doing for a few
                                years now,<br>
                                is to not only reintroduce the Doors Quarterly Magazine
                                as it once was,<br>
                                making sure that both the publications as well as
                                Rainer's many years of<br>
                                dedication and aspiring work would not go down unnoticed
                                in the 21st<br>
                                Century. It is also about moving forward from the time
                                when DQM seized<br>
                                to exist. To rewind and focus a bit on the more important
                                things in 'Doors<br>
                                land' since the final issue of DQM, in June of 1999.
                                Prominently, the<br>
                                many releases of music both reissued and previously
                                unpublished -<br>
                                officially that is. Bootlegs released after 1999, still
                                relevant and<br>
                                worthwile reviewing today: I'm sure that we will find
                                them and give<br>
                                them proper attention. So, that being the motivation to
                                go back 16<br>
                                years in time and write about what 'Doors land' looked
                                like then, here<br>
                                is a first of what might be called 'retro reviews'.<br>
                                <br>
                                Explaining my cautious approach to the aforementioned
                                news from the<br>
                                turning of the Century... Wheeling back some more, say to
                                1983 perhaps,<br>
                                is the key to understanding what it was like to be a
                                demanding Doors fan<br>
                                in pre Bright Midnight Archives times, perhaps in pre
                                internet times as well<br>
                                for that matter. Sure, 'Alive She Cried' (1983) was
                                awesome for the lion's<br>
                                share of the public - unpublished recordings, including
                                two songs that<br>
                                weren't on any of the existing albums, not forgetting
                                Jim's poetry in places.<br>
                                Great! Yet for the more weathered fan, and in particular
                                for the long time<br>
                                collector of tapes and bootlegs, it was but the tip of
                                the iceberg and hardly<br>
                                anything new at all. They knew about the real extent of
                                the vaults, they<br>
                                could tell that most of the material on the new album was
                                heavily edited,<br>
                                cut and pieced together, not unlike 'Absolutely Live' 13
                                years prior to date.<br>
                                Still, better than nothing at all was the motto for even
                                the most die hard<br>
                                completist. The 1980's was the decade of a handful of
                                video releases,<br>
                                which in term held a wealth of freshly surfaced material,
                                most notably 'Live<br>
                                at the Hollywood Bowl' (1987) from which a mini (!) LP
                                was derrived. The<br>
                                optimistic, and perhaps correct way to label the vinyl /
                                cassette / CD, would<br>
                                be EP; Extended Play. Cool! Although many a fan preffered
                                to plug the video<br>
                                tape of the concert instead: the complete concert, or
                                should I say: what<br>
                                was available at the time. Surely, soon enough audio tape
                                copies were<br>
                                being made, opening the floodgates for bootleggers to
                                confiscate a piece<br>
                                of the cake.<br>
                                <br>
                                After that, things got quiet, both of the 1980's live
                                albums quickly went<br>
                                out of print, and by the end of the decade there was a
                                certain gap in the<br>
                                Doors back catalogue on CD: 'Absolutely Live'. That soon
                                changed in 1991,<br>
                                in the slipstream of 'The Doors' movie, with the huge
                                boost of interest in<br>
                                the band: the Doors were hot, and they were all over the
                                place. 'The Doors<br>
                                in Concert' was advertised as being the set compiling,
                                and thus making<br>
                                obsolete, the existing live catalogue at the time, but in
                                that it failed.<br>
                                &quot;Where's the Hollywood Bowl concert?!&quot;...
                                Eventually, the wait for that<br>
                                brought us as far as 2012, that year finally produced the
                                concert in its<br>
                                entirity - more on that in a future feature. But that was
                                it, really.<br>
                                <br>
                                Reissues and compilations, yes, we got all of those.
                                Leaving us wondering<br>
                                when we would be granted something new finally, and what
                                would that<br>
                                be; were the vaults ever to be exposed in the first
                                place? Sure! But it was<br>
                                a long slow process, a project lingering for too long a
                                time, the conception<br>
                                of what we had all been waiting for: 'The Doors: Box Set'
                                (1997). Much,<br>
                                very much can be said about this and I won't go into any
                                detail for it has<br>
                                been reviewed with great precission for the Doors
                                Quarterly at the time of<br>
                                its release. I, to be completely honest, was
                                disappointed. But that was me,<br>
                                with a flightcase stuffed with bootlegs in the CD format,
                                and with a clear<br>
                                idea of what else was out there; untouched and ignored,
                                while disc number<br>
                                4 of this long awaited archival project was nothing more
                                than an upteenth<br>
                                collection of album tracks! Further cut, copy and paste
                                jobs on the 'Live<br>

                                Cried' style, all over<br>
                                again. So, no. Once again: Great! Cool! But no. And that
                                was pretty much<br>
                                it for the remainder of the Century, the Millennium
                                even... Until that<br>
                                newspaper ad, some time in the year 2000.<br>
                                <br>
                                Hoping for the best, though expecting the usual, Doors
                                fans around the<br>
                                world eagerly awaited the birth of 'The Bright Midnight

                                Announced as being an apetiser for the many things to
                                come in due<br>
                                time, at hindsight it's nothing more than a selection of
                                the concerts that<br>
                                have been dedicated to CD and/or LP in their entirity -
                                bar one; at the<br>
                                time of writing. But hey! The day this baby landed in my
                                mailbox...<br>
                                Let's have a closer look:<br>
                                <br>
                                'Light My Fire' opens the set. Thankfully not the
                                rendition we got on both<br>
                                'Alive She Cried' and 'The Doors in Concert', this is
                                from the Philadelphia<br>
                                show. And, more importantly: this first track was an
                                early sign that a<br>
                                different deck of cards had been laid out. No cuts, no
                                edits, no taking out<br>
                                the weak bits, leaving in the bum notes and further
                                flaws... This was real<br>
                                and raw! Not the best ever performance of the song, not
                                by far, but who<br>
                                cares! At last, finally here was something new. 'Been
                                Down So Long'<br>
                                followed, from the excellent concert the Doors did in
                                Detroit - remember,<br>
                                these recordings were all done in 1969 and 1970, with a
                                live album in<br>
                                mind. A very rare live take of the 'L.A. Woman' album
                                song, unreleased<br>
                                at the time of the concert, 'Been Down So Long' was new
                                to the Detroit<br>
                                crowd filling the Cobo Arena on May 8, 1970. A mean
                                stomping blues<br>
                                the way only the Doors could do it, courtesy of their
                                forming days,<br>
                                playing blues standards at the clubbing scene of Los
                                Angeles.<br>
                                <br>
                                That was it, by the time of this second track I was
                                stunned! Next up was<br>
                                more of the blues: 'Back Door Man', as part of a medley
                                coupled with<br>
                                'Love Hides' and 'Five To One' - exactly the way people
                                attending the<br>
                                show in Pittsburgh heard it 30 years prior to date; no
                                edits. Listening<br>
                                closely for echoes from the existing live albums left the
                                spectator<br>
                                unsuccesful. Has this &quot;sampler&quot; really been put
                                together in a fashion<br>
                                void of any takes, of cuts being repeated? It sure seems
                                to be just that,<br>
                                an assumption further materialised by the next couple of
                                songs: both<br>
                                from the shows at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles,
                                'Touch Me' and<br>
                                'The Crystal Ship' debuted as live tracks here. Onwards,
                                'Break On<br>
                                Through' does sound familiar here and there, it is
                                possible that this<br>
                                performance from the Felt Forum in New York City was
                                partly used for<br>
                                the oddly titled 'Break On Thru, #2' on initial pressings
                                of 'Absolutely<br>
                                Live'. The same could be said about the following,
                                'Roadhouse Blues'<br>
                                from Boston: tiny bits and pieces, certain fragments do
                                sound as if<br>
                                they were thrown in the mix for the well known rendition
                                that has<br>
                                appeared on so many albums and videos, starting with 'An
                                American<br>
                                Prayer' in 1978. Ignoring 'Bellowing' from Boston, none
                                of the<br>
                                remaining three recordings had ever been used before in
                                any way:<br>
                                'Alabama Song' (New York), 'The End' (Detroit), 'Love Me
                                Two Times /<br>
                                Baby Please Don't Go / St. James Infirmary'
                                (Bakersfield). The medley,<br>
                                perhaps being the biggest surprise, is of a lesser sound
                                quality; an<br>
                                audience registration instead of the soundboard
                                recordings by the team<br>
                                working for Elektra Records. Rough and raw, it's what we
                                had been<br>
                                demanding for so many years, so no one's complaining
                                about this little<br>
                                gem, included for its sheer rarity, unheard of by the non
                                bootleg<br>
                                buying / trading public.<br>
                                <br>
                                Overall evaluation? At the time, in September of 2000:
                                eleven out of ten!<br>
                                And the best news was that this would only be a start, so
                                it seemed that<br>
                                with Bright Midnight Archives, the tide had turned and
                                Doors fans would<br>
                                finally get what they had been anticipating for all those
                                years.<br>
                                With 'Bright Midnight', to be precise, the additional
                                word 'Archives' was<br>
                                introduced a few years later on. And the future would
                                hold further change<br>
                                for the young upstart label. For the first handful of
                                releases, the albums<br>
                                used to be available from the Doors and Rhino Handmade
                                websites only.<br>
                                There was no sign of the new product at shops, perhaps
                                the reason for<br>
                                Elektra to launch their own version of the album in 2001.
                                'Bright Midnight:<br>
                                Live in America' consisted of the exact same content so
                                one could get<br>
                                either this or that, completists hot on the heels of this
                                outpouring of new<br>
                                material, cashed in on both; the fact that Elektra made
                                it a &quot;Limited<br>
                                Edition&quot; helped push sales of their clone of the
                                amazing 'The Bright<br>
                                Midnight Samper'.<br>
                                <br>
                                Perhaps a bit dated nowadays, with all of the featured
                                shows out on CD<br>
                                in their entirety; bar one: we're still waiting for
                                Bakersfield. But the<br>
                                album makes for an excellent representative of what the
                                Doors were all<br>
                                about in concert, and we should think about it as if it
                                were the year 2000<br>
                                still. Perhaps it is very fitting for me to be doing this
                                retro reviewing today,<br>
                                now that the 50th Anniversary of the band is in sight; no
                                doubt that<br>
                                January 2017 and the following months and years will
                                yield further<br>
                                offerings from the Doors archives. Or so we are being
                                promised. Until<br>
                                then, Bright Midnight Archives is what we'll be focussing
                                on.<br>
