                                by Sonia de Pascalis<br>

                                Once, among some of the Doors admirers, a question rose on what
                                exactly the<em> 'crystal ship' </em>&#146;s poetic figure
                                represents.<br>
                                I came up to some considerations, which I would like to
                                share on this honored magazine.<br>
                                <br>
                                The image itself represents a man's soul seen like a
                                solid, fragile, sensitive, perceptively pure and
                                transparent body,<br>
                                but also a mystic vehicle, both individual and
                                collective, for reaching the world of total experience of
                                reality.<br>
                                This ship, to me, seems to be able to travel through both
                                sea and air, like in a nightly shrouded great ocean of
                                darkness.<br>
                                <br>
                                And here the story begins....<br>
                                <br>
                                It is made of crystal which, be it natural or handmade,
                                is a mystic material connected to vision and associated<br>
                                to the power of purifying, empowering and filtering
                                spiritual energies and vital forces.<br>
                                <br>
                                The purified senses stand in the transparent and lucid
                                crystal which also usually shines in glimpses.<br>
                                <br>
                                On one level, the ship is a symbol of the poet's soul,
                                sailing away successfully, although through suffering,<br>
                                from a sentimental world of defeat, after the breaking up
                                of a loving relationship, despite whatever will<br>
                                become of his lost partner.<br>
                                <br>
                                But there is more than this, another level of meaning,
                                philosophical and empirical.<br>
                                <br>
                                In this other dimension, on one hand, the <em>crystal ship</em>
                                is still the metaphor for the soul itself, but seen
                                outside of the<br>
                                sentimental realm: it is a person's spirit, sailing pure
                                through an experience travel and towards the paradise
                                world<br>
                                of total vision of reality.<br>
                                <br>
                                Somewhere it has been said that this ship has the
                                capacity of reading in its helmsman's mind...<br>
                                <br>
                                On the other hand the ship is a collective vehicle: it is
                                a medium that calls the soul, leading to the vision, like
                                during the<br>
                                journey, like at the end of it. This paradise, the final
                                destination world, can be opened by collecting every
                                experience made<br>
                                during the journey and at the same time it is built
                                gathering together the results of many experiences,
                                levels and states<br>
                                of consciousness from a single person and from a group of
                                people: the ship is made for and from getting together
                                such<br>
                                individual states of mind and perception.<br>
                                <br>
                                As a vehicle for the spirit, it is the pure and
                                transparent means allowing the vision of the world
                                outside,<br>
                                and to filter and store on board things that a passenger
                                relinquishes along the travel.<br>
                                <br>
                                On board you find people and other ways of experiencing,
                                feeling and having emotions.<br>
                                <br>
                                But these things are, at the same time, belonging to
                                three different levels: first, things you get by the ship
                                itself, second,<br>
                                experiences stored inside it, from the outside world
                                along the trip. Finally, they are also adventures that
                                happen in life on<br>
                                board with other travel mates.<br>
                                <br>
                                Jim Morrison directly revealed that the image of the
                                crystal ship was taken from a figure named in '<em>Connla'</em>
                                's tale,<br>
                                a legend contained in the ancient Irish '<em>Lebour na
                                hUidre'</em> (in English: '<em>the</em> <em>Book of the Dun
                                Cow')</em>, and from there it takes its<br>
                                basic meaning of a sacred and mystic vehicle to a
                                paradise world of blessed experience, populated, among
                                the rest, by<br>
                                thousands of women. The most that is renown about this,
                                is reported by Chuck Crisafulli in his 'Moonlight Drive:
                                the stories<br>
                                behind every Doors song'. He says Jim talked with
                                Patricia Kennealy-Morrison about the celtic derivation of
                                '<em>the Crystal Ship</em>'<br>
                                theme, that he knew <em>Connla</em>'s legend and that it
                                came from '<em>Lebour na hUidre</em>'. I can't say if he
                                actually read the original<br>
                                story, called '<em>Etchra Condla Chaim meic Cuind
                                Chetchathaig'</em>, included in '<em>The Book of the Dun
                                Cow</em>', or just some report of it,<br>
                                which anyway are rare and precise. From the clues, Jim at
                                least got it from from a very faithful version, probably
                                '<em>Connla of<br>
                                the Golden Hair and the Fairy Maiden' </em>by Patrick
                                Weston Joyce, who in his book '<em>Old Celtic Romances</em>'
                                revealed the legend's<br>
                                origin and gave its reference. Morrison grabbed the
                                original to some extent, or really read it too. One of
                                the reasons is that<br>
                                <em>Connla'</em>s story comes from two ancient manuscripts,
                                but in Morrison's case, just '<em>the Book of the Dun Cow</em>'
                                is always<br>
                                reported. I only doubt the availability of its readable
                                copies outside Ireland. Anyway, he knew enough of it, and
                                so I'll name<br>
                                the tale Jim meant as '<em>Etchra Condla</em>' 's.

                                Morrison sees in
                                that crystal vessel a means of perception and knowledge,
                                that also enshrines in itself a world of<br>
                                perfected experience, which there isn't in the original
                                tale. He sees it as the paradise of cleansed experience,
                                in<br>
                                William Blake' s and Aldous Huxley's perspective.<br>

                                and just to a superficial direct reference: it is highly
                                presumable that Morrison slightly made the

                                between this author's world and the tale of Connla,

                                Doors song &#145;<em>The Crystal Ship</em>&#146;.<br>

                                In fact, he had already done it while reading '<em>Etchra
                                Condla</em>' 's tale for the first time, in some moment
                                before finding<br>
                                himself involved in a particular happening, which
                                triggered and produced the very intuition and composition
                                of '<em>The<br>
                                Crystal Ship'</em> itself.

                                But just in that very moment he kind of came to the real
                                understanding of what, to him, the crystal ship of '<em>Etchra<br>
                                Condla'</em> was.

                                The ship of visionary experience itself was taking shape in front of
                                his eyes. Only <b>now</b><em> </em>he experienced and
                                understood<br>
                                it fully. Many Doors admirers know that this image, and
                                maybe the whole poem, was inspired by the lights of an

                                tanker or plant, which Jim saw offshore either of isla

                                strongly says,<br>
                                or wants to believe), or from one of the L.A. beaches
                                (Santa Monica or even Venice itself).<br>
                                <br>
                                He saw these lights floating in the deep darkness of the
                                all-in-one abyss of the nightly ocean and sky, altogether<br>
                                fused: in that very instant he must have done the match.<br>
                                <br>
                                In fact, the scene could only immediately recall him the
                                mystical ship of <em>Connla</em>, the<em> curragh </em>(which
                                in the story is<br>
                                actually called a boat, and more often a canoe: '<em>strong

                                <br>
                                </em>A '<em>Straight gliding, strong, crystal canoe'</em>
                                which can protect prince Connla '<em>from druids and the
                                demons of the air'</em>,<br>
                                since, like Crisafulli smartly described it, it is
                                capable of flying, more than sailing, over sea or land,
                                during his travel<br>
                                towards a Fairyland (<em>Mag Mell &#150; the Plain of
                                Delights)</em>. This land, in Celtic tradition, is an
                                eternal realm after death,<br>
                                accessible to the sacred kings, like Connla. Religiously,
                                Connla represents the immortal part of the king's soul.
                                It<br>
                                was believed that if this part of the king's soul went to
                                reside forever in that realm, it would allow the rest of
                                his<br>
                                spirit to be reborn into his kingly successor in the
                                earthly world.<br>
                                <br>
                                Jim had probably already made the match between this
                                paradise, plus the crystal ship as a container, and
                                William<br>
                                Blake's concept of <em>Belulah</em>, the heavenly dimension
                                attained by 'breaking through' (which is not a concept<br>
                                namely belonging neither to Blake, nor to Aldous Huxley).
                                Besides that, in their imagery these things are<br>
                                represented with some precise objects, but there are no
                                ships.<br>
                                <br>
                                That night, Jim was on his way to make up his mind about
                                his break up with Mary Werbelow.<br>
                                <br>
                                Both the Irish tale and a particular poem of William
                                Blake, the <em>Crystal Cabinet</em>, involve the sensual
                                relationship with<br>
                                a woman as the medium to access this paradise world, and
                                the crystal object as the instrument in their pertinence,<br>
                                to accomplish it. And so the match was made. But Blake
                                talks about a partially betraying and false love
                                intercourse,<br>
                                and Morrison rewrote his own idea of the story told in
                                the <em>Crystal Cabinet</em> in all the first part of his
                                poem-song, the<br>
                                only one where he actually talks about Mary and him.<br>
                                <br>
                                Things change when the <em>crystal ship</em>'s vision comes
                                in: it suddenly tells another story from Blake's, and it
                                follows<br>
                                the only reference Jim willingly recognized, <em>Etchra
                                Condla</em>.<br>
                                <br>
                                Surely, from the very first time he met the Irish tale,
                                he had been knowing that the crystalline dimension that
                                Blake<br>
                                does use in his imagery, to him, were more likely a ship,
                                than anything else.<br>
                                <br>
                                But until that very moment on the beach, he hadn't
                                visualized it so clearly and definitely.<br>
                                <br>
                                Suddenly ... it appeared the real presence of an
                                enlightened structure in the floating black ... and Jim
                                saw the whole<br>
                                thing from a totally different aspect than Blake's
                                imagery.<br>
                                <br>
                                Just focusing the scene amidst the ocean, he understood
                                that for him the purified senses and their perceptions<br>
                                container where nothing but a ship, sailing exactly in
                                that way, no matter how his literary mentors represented
                                them.<br>
                                And now it was just manifesting itself in front of his
                                eyes, together with all his romantic struggling for the
                                end of his<br>
                                last long term love relationship.<br>
                                <br>
                                In the same way, he was aware that where <em>Condla</em>'s
                                canoe differed from Blake's concept, it had all the
                                characteristics<br>
                                of Rimbaud's <em>intoxicated boat.<br>
                                <br>

                                Manonnan's </em>boat / womb, but it knows and moves
                                according to its passenger's<br>
                                and conductor's mind.

                                Like the Irish legend, both Rimbaud and Morrison use a boat to
                                symbolize a place of totally free experience and
                                perception,<br>
                                and at the same time the experimenting soul and senses of
                                the poet.<br>
                                <br>
                                In<em> 'le Bateau Ivre'</em> ('<em>The Intoxicated Boat')</em>,
                                Rimbaud metaphorizes himself as the vessel, whose body
                                dips in and directly<br>
                                absorbs the effect of the sailing experience.<br>
                                <br>
                                In Morrison's case, the self identification with the ship
                                is also the natural consequence of the fact that it comes
                                out in the middle<br>
                                of him writing about his feelings for parting from Mary:
                                it springs out by a subjective, first person and
                                sentimental stream of<br>
                                consciousness, and thus he visualized it in this
                                particular way.<br>
                                <br>
                                The ship is Jim's own reaction to the situation he was
                                living, absolutely opposite to what Blake represents in <em>The</em>
                                <em>Crystal<br>
                                Cabinet</em>. Jim's ship represents the world of
                                imagination and experience, and not love anymore. It is a
                                declaration of taking<br>
                                possession of freedom from the restrictions of moral and
                                of control, exactly like it is in the <em>Intoxicated Boat</em>.
                                But the presence<br>
                                of Rimbaud in this poem is so fused to Morrison's concept
                                of the ship, that it is neither quoted, nor imitated.<br>
                                <br>
                                It is embedded and embodied in the ship's image itself,
                                and replaced directly by the author's own original
                                vision.

                                When he was inspired to write this poem song, anyway, Morrison
                                figured it out as an expression of Blake's general
                                concept:<br>
                                there is a world of cleansed vision of things, accessible
                                by man in certain states of mind or during certain life
                                experiences such<br>
                                as, also, love relationships, sexual intercourse and
                                their effects (for Jim the ship in the <em>Book of the Dun
                                Cow</em> automatically<br>
                                meant this).<br>
                                <br>
                                But Morrison's c<em>rystal ship</em> has another original
                                characteristic, both in front of the Irish tale and of
                                Blake's: the protagonist<br>
                                identifies his own spirit with the ship, but at the same
                                time he sees himself as its passenger. A totally
                                unprecedented<br>
                                association of both these aspects together.<br>
                                <br>
                                At the climax point, conditioned by the sight of an
                                enlightened ship or plant offshore in the ocean, in
                                reality outside, he<br>
                                identifies himself with it, in this double sense.<br>
                                <br>
                                Another original aspect of Morrison's ship: it is a
                                collectively built medium, that picks up a group on
                                board.<br>
                                <br>
                                A shared medium of vision, of experiencing and storing
                                knowledge together with one another, which he'll
                                represent again in<br>
                                <em>The End</em>&#146;s &#145;<em>blue bus</em>&#146; and
                                other symbolical vehicles scattered throughout his lines.<br>
                                <br>
                                John Densmore has suggested that the ship represented the
                                Doors themselves: he totally grabbed its core meaning,
                                though<br>
                                I wouldn't namely identify it with the group itself.<br>
                                <br>
                                It surely represents the music and the artistic project
                                that they were building on: creating a conceptual and
                                spiritual vehicle for<br>
                                opening minds, as his personal example to indicate a
                                universal collective medium for accessing the hidden
                                realities which<br>
                                lead to interior rebirth or resurrection during life
                                course. The <em>crystal ship</em> is more than the music:
                                it's the Doors songs, and<br>
                                among the passengers, the musicians are the crew
                                (again... <em>The End: 'driver where you're taking us'</em>,
                                meant like acid but also<br>
                                and mainly like the drivers of the music bus calling the
                                audience: them four). More, 'it is <b>this</b> song',
                                forming the crystal ship in<br>
                                people's minds, bringing people on the trip: it builds it
                                up, fusing Jim's love loss feelings with the outbreaking
                                world of all<br>
                                experiences that he has had and that he is having. This
                                way, he sails away from 'Mary's womb', with his soul
                                untouched, nay,<br>
                                forged by their own sad epilogue, though thru' the sea of
                                sorrow and parting. This vehicle, created by the song,
                                with the crystal<br>
                                ship evocation at its core, makes of his experience with
                                Mary too, one of those, although a main one, which and by
                                which his<br>
                                soul's ship, and the ship of collective experience, is
                                being filled.<br>
                                <br>
                                I would say it symbolizes the context and texture of
                                their artistic progress, in which Jim saw himself and the
                                others involved<br>
                                and dipped (or 'drowned'...) in.<br>
                                <br>
                                But Jim's intent went beyond it, over the material and
                                subjective identification with the Doors, their music and
                                their songs: they<br>
                                are the practical example in Jim's life to indicate
                                universally any collective spiritual means of ecstasy and
                                mind intoxication that<br>
                                people can build, and so it shall be seen.<br>
                                <br>
                                This poem, anyway, says that the Doors embodied the
                                context in which those ideas were taking shape, opposed
                                to what Mary<br>
                                and his relationship with her represented. On them and on
                                those ideas he leverages to overcome altogether what was
                                going on<br>
                                with her and it all, &#145;breaking on through&#146;.<br>
                                <br>
                                People uphold that it represents something fragile and
                                apparently stately as only a troubled love can be, and
                                that exactly this is<br>
                                the central theme of the story Jim Morrison tells in the
                                song.<br>
                                <br>
                                I believe that the description of a troubled love with
                                some fragility at the bottom, immortalized in its moment
                                of trespassing, is<br>
                                actually one if the leading meanings of the text. But
                                love here is the only frangible thing: the ship is also
                                this, and a lover's spirit.<br>
                                In the figure, this feeling is visually represented as a
                                force to set one free, in a forceful crystalline
                                appearance; the ship is <b>not</b><br>
                                shattered, nor it appears easy to be crushed, though the
                                poet's heart could be.<br>
                                <br>
                                But in truth this love is characterized over all by some
                                stateliness, a far from frangible lover's spirit, which
                                is not just apparent,<br>
                                although it leaves some permanent scars at its bottom.
                                This moment of sentimental trespassing is a real <em>break
                                on through</em>, to<br>
                                use the proper words, which involves a concrete
                                acquirement of strength and overcoming, still leaving
                                those scars visible.<br>
                                <br>
                                More, the surrounding lyrics and the story talk about
                                this love theme, but <em>the</em> c<em>rystal ship</em>'s
                                figure itself is apart from it, and it has<br>
                                got nothing to do with the sentimental declarations about
                                Mary and Jim.<br>
                                <br>
                                More than ever, it is a picture of breaking through in
                                the purest Doors sense, the symbol of the
                                protagonist&#146;s decision how to<br>
                                conduct his own life, both in biographic sentimental life
                                and emotional-active life.<br>
                                <br>
                                But first of all, the <em>crystal ship</em> is the world of
                                expanded perceptions, of the purified inner reality
                                inside, the embodiment of the<br>
                                strong and bright spirit of the poet and the figure of
                                cleansed experience which brings this spirit to come to
                                life and shine.<br>
                                <br>
                                As the poet's spirit, it symbolizes the experimenting
                                soul, although it involves also his sentimental side (but
                                not directly his heart,<br>
                                even if it remains as a secondary shade in background). <br>
                                <br>
                                It represents the figure of a cleansed experience,
                                general, absolute, but also an individual and collective
                                one (first, the collective<br>
                                archetype of experience itself, second, the individual
                                world of experience).<br>
                                <br>
                                It is a sort of transparent shrine including it, which
                                leads to the polished world of perception and produces
                                that subjective spirit<br>
                                itself. Its shining and clear sides are already
                                themselves that world and its purity, but at the same
                                time they also embody the<br>
                                cleansed senses and mind swallowing it.<br>
                                <br>
                                In conclusion, this ship of experience is inspired by the
                                vision of the oil tanker or plant in the ocean, all
                                enlightened, transformed<br>
                                into Jim Morrison's own specific existential-sentimental
                                version of <em>'Etchra Condla' '</em>s ship<em>, </em>and<em>
                                of the intoxicated boat.</em>

                                A friend of mine, Alessandro
                                Amoroso, took in a lot of the suggestions for '<em>the
                                Crystal Cabinet'</em>'s involving, and<br>
                                compared the crystal ship to Blake's metaphor, because
                                both poems express a dream of freedom, the desire of<br>
                                the other side, love like a way of setting oneself free,
                                unbound and intact again, getting rid of reason, and a<br>
                                way of changing.<br>
                                <br>
                                But as I argued before, the figure mainly remains
                                referring to '<em>the Intoxicated Boat'</em>, in its
                                figurative concept,<br>
                                because Rimbaud's poem already has all of these contents.
                                Except for the one of love: but from this, Morrison<br>
                                takes the flight.<br>
                                <br>
                                To be precise: he takes the flight from this delusional
                                love. Unlike Blake, and like, instead, Rimbaud. In the
                                french<br>
                                poet's case this happens not from love, but from the
                                delusions of people and of the social state, who didn't<br>
                                welcome the existential change and didn't permit to the
                                material reality to take profit of the fruits produced by<br>
                                total experience, and by the systematic derangement of
                                all the senses.<br>
                                <br>
                                It wouldn't allow the poet to live it in the world that
                                he really wants to live in: the earthly one, and forces
                                him in<br>
                                the imagination paradise of poetry, which at length means
                                death, and estrangement from <em>any</em> reality. William<br>
                                Blake, in '<em>the Crystal Cabinet'</em>, loses the world
                                of heaven, <em>Belulah</em>, just to end tossed out of the
                                Earthly world,<br>
                                <em>Eternity</em>, through a forced rebirth of him as a
                                child, more in woes than crying out for a new life, and
                                of his lover<br>
                                as a blindly suffering woman after giving birth: they
                                both find themselves in the hell of suffering, <em>Ulro</em>.
                                On the<br>
                                contrary, the trip to the Fairyland of <em>Etchra Condla</em>
                                is a solemn promise and premise for the kings
                                reincarnation,<br>
                                although by another part of his spirit.<br>
                                <br>
                                Rimbaud's travel as the <em>intoxicated boat</em>, has no
                                full and happy return to the earthly world he misses: he
                                remains<br>
                                ideally into the ocean of his boat's adventurous travels,
                                and at the same time he projects himself back at home<br>
                                like a child playing in a water pool with a paper boat,
                                resigned to keep his gained freedom of existence intact
                                and<br>
                                bring it in real life, in the restricted ways he can. Not
                                the ideal one, but there is a way back. The poet himself
                                wants<br>
                                and forces it: the important thing, '<em>when everything
                                else fails'</em> is to keep a constant personal rebellion
                                into his own<br>
                                spirit.<br>
                                <br>
                                The same thing does Jim: he goes straight to achieve
                                paradise and has all intentions to hold it, but: '<em>When
                                we get<br>
                                back, I'll drop a line'</em>. He's saying Mary that for no
                                reason at all his fall in experience with her has
                                precluded him the<br>
                                earthly world and condemned him to hell.<br>
                                <br>
                                We could say that, in the <em>crystal ship</em> figure,
                                like in the second part of Morrison's poem, Blake is just
                                an allusion,<br>
                                just like 'crystal<em>' </em>is an adjective. The noun,
                                'ship', says of '<em>Etchra Condla'</em> 's and '<em>the
                                Intoxicated Boat' </em>'s basis.<br>
                                <br>

                                    the pure world of perception:

                                In these lines Morrison takes the distance from his
                                love pain and its implication with his loved one: he says
                                that<br>
                                the ways of experience and of life itself, which they had
                                both chosen, but especially hers, are wearing and<br>
                                impenitent places.<br>
                                <br>
                                That is to say, intense but also tiring, above all when
                                you are alone.<br>
                                <br>
                                That question, '<em>where your freedom lies'</em>, is the
                                way off the romantic sentimental world.<br>
                                <br>
                                The ship is exactly that freedom he's talking about, the
                                freedom to experience in general, freedom of
                                experiencing,<br>
                                freedom to emotion, freedom of emotions and towards other
                                feelings too.<br>
                                <br>
                                In this ship women and trips, or emotions (originally
                                indicated as '<em>pills'</em>, then changed into '<em>thrills'</em>),
                                represent both<br>
                                the actual passengers of the collective ship, and the
                                content of any individual's inner boat.<br>
                                <br>
                                We'll see further that the ship's passengers (girls and
                                pills / thrills) are single elements of experience in
                                general,<br>
                                collective aims, which crowd the vessel, but at the same
                                time other people who climb on board to take this sailing<br>
                                trip, the others in this experience. The poet's spirit
                                trip mates (still, girls and pills / thrills) are both
                                other companions<br>
                                and reasonable contents of the poet's mind and soul,
                                elements of &#145;knowledge&#146;, another crucial word
                                to Morrison.<br>
                                <br>
                                In the background of this all, the picture draws a
                                natural sentimental fragility in experience and emotions
                                and for a<br>
                                shattered love feeling, but at the same time it contrasts
                                it.<br>
                                <br>
                                This is the feeling of a sentient animal with a fragile
                                but forged and reborn sensitive soul.<br>
                                <br>
                                From this point on, all over the second part of the song,
                                the poem transforms into a taking of a position: Jim
                                states<br>
                                he has made up his mind both sentimentally and

                            He wanted to walk some artistic
                            path with her, but not in the direction she seemed to
                            lead, not to be a valuable<br>
                            partner for such an interest she demonstrated (the double
                            sensed picture which emerges in '<em>Twentieth Century<br>
                            Fox'</em> may be well related to this). It feels like he
                            saw himself as a partner that now seems an inconvenience
                            and<br>
                            even an obstacle for possible alternate relationships or
                            sexual experiences. Like he felt her need for other<br>
                            experiences as a pretense to leave him or take time. On
                            the other hand he wouldn't think of them as an obstacle<br>
                            for their staying together, or at least he was beginning
                            to think about it that way. Now one that once seemed a<br>
                            reasonable earnest need of hers, appears to be a shaded
                            excuse or a hiding of the fact that she doesn't love him<br>
                            anymore.<br>
                            <br>
                            Still, painfully, disarmingly sweet, he had whispered
                            her: &#147;<em>the</em> <em>streets </em>(in general, but in
                            particular the ones of you<br>
                            walk in your life)<em> are fields that never die</em>&#148;.
                            They are wearing, they offer no shelter. But then, '<em>deliver

                            <br>
                            </em>&#145;Why do you want to embrace the <b>limited</b>
                            experience world?&#146;<br>
                            <br>
                            He seems to tell her: 'Your plans are all the result of
                            this choice, not opening the doors of perception, and so
                            you<br>
                            prefer to suffer, make existential choices that are not
                            needed, where no renounces would be requested'. '<em>Why<br>
                            you'd rather cry'</em> means, &#145;Why choosing the
                            limited experience world?&#146;.<br>
                            <br>
                            <em>'I'd rather fly': </em>I prefer to fly in the expanded
                            world of perceptions, of all inclusive love and love
                            experiences, of<br>
                            an artistic world of life and creation... with it the
                            poem has already become an oniric declaration, and the
                            oniric<br>
                            detachment of Jim's from Mary&#146;s.<br>
                            <br>
                            It indicates the severing of his perception of experience
                            from the need to consider her, as his lover, a means to<br>
                            access it.<br>
                            <br>
                            Looking back, in the second strophe of the text, '<em>enclose
                            me in your gentle rain'</em>, he still aimed at it for a
                            last time:<br>
                            the poem had begun with the statement of wanting to have
                            '<em>another kiss, another flashing chance at </em>(that)<em>
                            bliss'<br>
                            </em>though just to let her '<em>slip into unconsciousness'</em>.<br>
                            <br>
                            He wants to forget her, or better, chop off his loving
                            bound, in part, and Mary's role as a sensuous mean of<br>
                            experience, in total. He doesn't recognize her as a muse
                            anymore. I mean a muse in this very particular sense,<br>
                            and not in the conventional one (a last chance of holding
                            her as a way to sentimental and perceptive bliss &#150;
                            Jim<br>
                            used this very line just to express, also, one of his
                            ways to drinking, where every glass is a bet to access
                            the<br>
                            bliss of perception, one more moment of bliss, or to pass
                            the line and get into emotional and intellectual hell,<br>
                            confirming that '<em>another chance at bliss'</em> alludes
                            to the kiss, or anything else in its place, as a medium
                            for<br>
                            accessing <b>that</b> dimension).<br>
                            <br>
                            But it seems impossible to have neither the kiss nor 'a
                            last access to bliss', so right now, with '<em>Deliver me
                            from<br>
                            reasons why / you'd rather cry, I'd rather fly' </em>he
                            makes up his mind to get rid of it. It is such a radical
                            decision,<br>
                            that he even moves away from his original desire and
                            intentions of pursuing a last farewell moment, from his<br>
                            need of it. He gives up the idea of accessing <em>End of
                            the Night</em>'s '<em>realms of bliss'</em> by their tender
                            bound, even for a<br>
                            last time. <em>'I'd rather fly'</em>, then: the oniric
                            leave-taking.<br>
                            <br>
                            And so comes the <em>crystal ship</em>, which '<em>is being
                            filled'</em>, originally, with '<em>a thousand pills'</em>,
                            both in the sense that it<br>
                            consists of them (there is no &#147;of&#148;), and in the
                            sense that this &#147;of&#148; is implied: like people,
                            like pills are gathering<br>
                            on board, the ship is being loaded (the ship with people,
                            people with experience. Filled by other people, and by<br>
                            thrilling experiences), about to depart.<br>
                            <br>
                            I think the change from '<em>pills'</em> to '<em>thrills'</em>
                            wasn't just convenient for censorship reasons, but it
                            also shows that '<em>pills</em>'<br>
                            indicated rather the effect they produce, and not the
                            item itself. Like the ship, <em>pills </em>are a symbol for
                            both any<br>
                            means you can use to get the experience and for the
                            experience itself (both drugs as ecstasy inducers and the<br>
                            musicians- leaders of the ship) - <em>thrills</em>,
                            instead, are double sense between emotions and
                            intoxication: the effect<br>
                            of pills, of the songs, of all the mediums built alike
                            the latter.<br>
                            <br>
                            Plus, keeping <em>'pills' </em>would have limited the
                            variety of sources for them that Morrison intended (maybe
                            he even<br>
                            reflected better and more deeply, while recording and
                            before publishing &#147;<em>The Doors</em>&#148;, their
                            first album, which<br>
                            would have meant reaching a larger base of listeners than
                            the clubs public).<br>
                            <br>
                            The oniric ship of experience and of the real full
                            discovery of reality effects the emerging of a cleansed
                            crystal<br>
                            shining spirit and a transparent vision with which
                            approaching the world.<br>
                            <br>
                            '<em>A million ways to spend your time'</em> refers to all
                            these things together, and even if the thousand girls
                            aren't meant<br>
                            to substitute his broken and lost relationship with Mary,
                            there will probably be another one who will do, no way to<br>
                            think that even if he will never completely overcome his
                            sentimental delusion and loss of her (who does?), he'll<br>
                            also still suffer for it, or won't access to a real true
                            love and mate forever. Jim now has decided that hers has<br>
                            become a &#147;falsely true&#148; love, from a certain
                            point on... and he has been knowing her for a long time.
                            Among that<br>
                            million ways to spend your time, anyway, rest also the
                            girl or girls of his future life who will substitute her.<br>
                            <br>
                            <em>'When we get back / I'll drop a line': </em>the pronoun
                            '<em>we'</em> confirms that the ship is also filled with
                            other people who<br>
                            want to acknowledge this way of living.<br>
                            <br>
                            The poet also states that at the end of this experience
                            trip he's going to inform her that he's back: &#147;<em>I'll
                            drop a line</em>&#148;<br>
                            is going to be the signal, and he will report her how it
                            went, too.<br>
                            <br>
                            It the end, in their relationship, they'll meet again, at
                            least to reckon where their mutual choices had led them
                            to.<br>
                            But in his frame of mind it feels like he meant: '<em>you'll
                            see that I was right!'</em>. Maybe, when 'the insane time
                            she ran'<br>
                            will have passed, they'll even get together again, but he
                            doesn't expect nor hopes for that. He doesn't even wish<br>
                            for it anymore: he doesn't aim anymore at that other
                            &quot;<em>flashing chance at bliss</em>&quot;, neither as a
                            last kiss of farewell.<br>
                            <br>
                            When they'll meet again, possibly they'll put their
                            friendship on another level. And it all happened...<br>
