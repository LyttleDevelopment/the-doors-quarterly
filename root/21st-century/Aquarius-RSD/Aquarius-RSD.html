                                double CD set in 2001, the Doors Music Company's own

                                When in 1969 the Doors and Elektra Records decided to
                                record 'in concert'<br>
                                performances to put out as a future live album, the
                                Aquarius Theatre in Los<br>
                                Angeles was chosen as the hosting venue for that. After
                                having recorded two<br>
                                sets as well as a private rehearsal session, the record
                                company wasn't fully<br>
                                satisfied and the band would go on to have a further
                                number of concerts<br>
                                taped by and for Elektra in 1970. The material considered
                                best suitable was<br>
                                then hand picked by producer Paul Rothchild, and
                                eventually released as<br>
                                the much praised 'Absolutely Live' double album in July
                                of 1970.<br>
                                Being pieced together from numerous sources, 'Absolutely
                                Live' does provide<br>
                                the perception of being one concert and it's hats off to
                                Rothchild and engineer<br>
                                Bruce Botnick for that. Botnick's work with the Doors
                                started as early as<br>
                                their debut album, and I'm convinced that he will go on
                                refining and enriching<br>
                                the Doors legacy in many years to come after this
                                beautiful 2016 product<br>
                                which, as is the case with all official Doors releases,
                                is the result of his<br>
                                masterful skills.<br>
                                <br>
                                Acknowledging Paul A. Rothchild who also stood by the
                                forming cradle of the<br>
                                Doors as a worldwide and lasting success, I'd like to
                                state that he sadly<br>
                                passed away as early as 1995.<br>
                                <br>
                                Although deemed not good enough for a live album back in
                                1969, a<br>
                                substantial number of cuts from the two Aquarius Theatre
                                shows found their<br>
                                way onto 'Absolutely Live'. From this particular set,
                                'The Celebration of the<br>
                                Lizard', the epic piece aborted from the third album,
                                'Waiting for the Sun'<br>
                                that after several failed attempts at a studio take the
                                previous year, got its<br>
                                debut on record. Sublimely merely edited by Paul and
                                Bruce, this rendition<br>
                                is almost identical on both 'Absolutely Live' and the
                                album I am reviewing<br>
                                today - it's easy and good fun spotting the differences.<br>
                                <br>
                                Extensive liner notes by both Bruce Botnick and the band
                                members unveil a<br>
                                nice bit of history as well as the technical side of the
                                production; Bruce going<br>
                                into detail about how the album came to be. Apparently,
                                due to technical<br>
                                difficulties, the entire show had to be remixed from the
                                analogue master<br>
                                tapes, making for a different listening experience
                                compared to the CD<br>
                                version - interesting, yet not very obvious to mark the
                                changes.<br>
                                <br>
                                So what about the actual music on this triple album,
                                limited to 8.500 copies<br>
                                worldwide, on beautiful clear 180g vinyl? It's July 1969,
                                and the Doors are<br>
                                trying to regain solid ground to support them as a
                                performing act after the<br>
                                disastrous incident that was the Miami concert the
                                previous March. Is the<br>
                                rather uncertain and cautious Jim Morrison at the start
                                of the concert a<br>
                                result of that, or is his almost shy introduction the
                                product of being slightly<br>
                                intimidated by the thought of tonight's deliverance being
                                registered for<br>
                                posterity? Neither him, nor the audience seem to hold
                                what it takes to pull<br>
                                the band into gear, not during a dry, uninspired 'Back
                                Door Man' anyway.<br>
                                The following 'Break on Through' does get things going -
                                the so important<br>
                                flow of energy going in circles between the band and its
                                audience starts<br>
                                happening. Four songs into the set, after the rather
                                shaky 'Soul Kitchen',<br>
                                comes a potentially difficult moment where new material
                                is being<br>
                                introduced, a couple of songs the spectators are not yet
                                (very) familiar<br>
                                with; 'You Make Me Real' wouldn't surface as a single
                                until March the<br>
                                following year, and the delicate bluesy ballad 'I Will
                                Never Be Untrue'<br>
                                would forever remain a rare, performed in concert only,
                                underrated<br>
                                precious little gem. But the audience is loving it,
                                devotedly they embrace<br>
                                both old and new, the following landmark that is
                                &quot;When the Music's Over&quot;<br>
                                receives a ravenous reception.<br>
                                <br>
                                But the Doors are recording tonight, and this leads them
                                to not quite play<br>
                                much of their known, previously recorded output, but
                                rather to put forward<br>
                                newer work as well as a further dip into the blues,
                                beyond 'Back Door Man',<br>
                                with cover versions of 'Mystery Train', 'Crossroads', and
                                'Who Do You Love'.<br>
                                It's all great, and everybody's loving it!<br>
                                <br>
                                By this time well relaxed and well oiled, Morrison leads
                                the band into<br>
                                newcomers 'Universal Mind' and 'Build Me a Woman' - both
                                fresh Doors<br>
                                originals, though the latter being in an early stage of
                                development still; it's<br>
                                not quite flying yet, the song hovers around a bit,
                                uncomfortably, without<br>
                                finding the means to make its statement. Ultimately,
                                after repeated<br>
                                requests from a very patient audience -the recording
                                process is pretty<br>
                                demanding: long pauses, quiet moments do bring down the
                                moods a bit-<br>
                                the Doors finally launch their biggest cannon to date and
                                fire an outstanding<br>
                                'Light my Fire' into the Aquarius Theatre. The Doors,
                                that is, as a band, not<br>
                                so much Morrison who appears rather bored with the song;
                                he plugs an<br>
                                air of &quot;do we really need to do this&quot; and sings
                                in an anything but<br>
                                impassioned fashion. Making up for that, Jim reconnects
                                with the right<br>
                                spirits for the final part of the show: the
                                aforementioned 'The Celebration<br>
                                of the Lizard', surely pinning each and every member of
                                the audience to<br>
                                their seat! This is the Doors not much loved by the
                                teenyboppers but this<br>
                                is what Jim Morrison is all about: poetry... and
                                Manzarek, Krieger and<br>
                                Densmore are his outstanding vehicle, backing up his
                                every word,<br>
                                delivering a driving, thrilling performance.<br>
                                <br>
                                Fantastic! And this was but the first of two sets at the
                                Aquarius Theatre<br>
                                today, on July 21st 1969. A different audience would
                                later fill the seats, a<br>
                                warmed up band would reemerge to once again deliver a

                                set up and taped specifically for the planned live album.
