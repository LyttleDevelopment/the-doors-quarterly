                                Anniversary of a classic. A retro review.<br>
                                1985 - 2020.<br>
                                Live Aid - COVID-19.<br>
                                Two cornerstones in recent history everyone old enough
                                will remember and never forget.<br>
                                This to illustrate how long this album has been around
                                for...<br>
                                <br>
                                For my 10th Birthday, in 1986, my old elementary school
                                friend was going to buy me a present. &quot;Are there any
                                Doors records you don't own yet?&quot;.<br>
                                I'll never forget the playground conversation that day. I
                                refused, he insisted... I didn't really need this, and I
                                told my friend so, because by this<br>
                                time I had collected most of the albums and there was
                                nothing new on it... Nevertheless, needless to say, I was
                                blown away and over the moon<br>
                                by his gesture. It's in my collection still, and meets up
                                with my record player every now and again.<br>
                                <br>
                                A bit of an oddball perhaps in the world of all things
                                Greatest Hits, Best Of, Platinum Collection, Archives and
                                so on. The world of compilation albums.<br>
                                &quot;The Doors Classics&quot; is not about the chart
                                topping hits, neither does it focus on what the public at
                                large would tag as the best songs, or the best known<br>
                                ones for that matter. Not a career overview and no
                                collection of rarities... There's no concept at all
                                really. These are classic songs by a classic band,<br>
                                final stop. Pointless? Perhaps so, especially in our
                                modern day and age where everything's online and up for
                                grabs on YouTube, Spotify, Amazon et al.<br>
                                We need to go back to 1985 to understand why the record
                                company felt the need for this.<br>
                                <br>
                                The 1980s had started with a huge renewed interest in the
                                Doors, with the inclusion of &quot;The End&quot; in the
                                movie &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; by Francis Ford<br>
                                Coppola. And then there was the first ever Jim Morrison
                                biography: &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot;, by
                                Jerry Hopkins and Danny Sugerman.<br>
                                Followed shortly by the Doors' debut home video, &quot;A
                                Tribute to Jim Morrison&quot;. Suddenly the band appeared
                                to be more popular and in higher<br>
                                demand than ever before. Added to this successful wave
                                was the 1980 &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation,
                                succeeded by a first opening of the vaults<br>
                                with 1983's &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot;. Both did very
                                well on the charts. Two years later, mid decade, with
                                interest in the Doors perhaps declining a bit,<br>
                                Elektra Records was not about to let their initial
                                flagship slip into oblivion. Hence a second home video
                                release, &quot;Dance On Fire&quot;, and indeed,<br>
                                &quot;The Doors Classics&quot;.<br>
                                <br>
                                So far never released on CD officially, &quot;The Doors
                                Classics&quot; stands as an interesting selection of both
                                the best and the greatest,<br>
                                mixed with some high end deep cuts. So here's the
                                tracklisting. It's easy and fun to pour the songs into a
                                Spotify playlist for example,<br>
                                to get the feel and flow of this longplayer. The featured
                                &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, by the way, is the well
                                known and much used live version<br>
                                that first appeared on &quot;An American Prayer&quot;,
                                later on &quot;The Doors In Concert&quot;, and so on...<br>
