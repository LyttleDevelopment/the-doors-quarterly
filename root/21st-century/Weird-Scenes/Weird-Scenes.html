                            print yet<br>
                            highly acclaimed compilation album &quot;Weird Scenes
                            Inside the Gold Mine&quot;<br>
                            was re-released. Limited to 5.500 copies worldwide, the
                            twin amber coloured<br>
                            vinyls look and sound better than ever before.<br>
                            <br>
                            &quot;Weird Scenes&quot; was originally released in
                            January of 1972, in between the<br>
                            two Doors albums without Jim, exactly 5 years after the
                            band's debut album<br>
                            had first seen the light of day. With a very cleverly
                            picked tracklist this is by<br>
                            no means a 'best of' nor a 'greatest hits' compilation;
                            the selection of songs<br>
                            goes much deeper than the traditional hits album concept.
                            In fact it was the<br>
                            follow up to &quot;13,&quot; the Doors' first compilation
                            album from November 1970.<br>
                            &quot;13&quot; already had most of the hit songs, and
                            none of its tracks were repeated<br>
                            on &quot;Weird Scenes&quot; - a wise decission, knowing
                            that the initial release did<br>
                            well on the charts.<br>
                            <br>
                            Making it even more interesting for the record buying
                            public at the time<br>
                            was the inclusion of two non album tracks, previously
                            available only on<br>
                            singles. &quot;Who Scared You&quot; and &quot;(You Need
                            Meat) Don't Go No Further&quot;<br>
                            were pretty much unheard of, and the album would remain
                            the only<br>
                            longplay source for these songs for several decades to
                            come. The former<br>
                            would finally surface on &quot;The Doors Box Set&quot; in
                            1997, but there was a<br>
                            problem: quality control had failed somehow and the song
                            as presented<br>
                            was incomplete, a verse had gone missing in the mix. This
                            was put<br>
                            straight two years later on &quot;Essential
                            Rarities,&quot; basically a 'best of the Box<br>
                            set with a bonus track.' It wasn't until 2006 when the
                            Ray Manzarek sung<br>
                            &quot;(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further&quot; found its
                            way onto CD, as a bonus<br>
                            on the remastered &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; album, initially
                            part of the &quot;Perception&quot;<br>
                            box set.<br>
                            <br>
                            Speaking of that, it's great to hear only original
                            masters on the reissued<br>
                            &quot;Weird Scenes.&quot; Not the remixes that appeared
                            as Audio DVD's in<br>
                            &quot;Perception&quot; first, and later as the standard
                            masters for the band's six<br>
                            album back catalogue - an entirely different subject,
                            that!<br>
                            <br>
                            There are no extras though, not even any new liner notes
                            to introduce the<br>
                            re-release; or, should we really moan about this? Here is
                            &quot;Weird Scenes&quot; as<br>
                            it was intended to be, in its beautifully illustrated
                            gatefold sleeve, a real<br>
                            pleasure to have and to hold...<br>
                            <br>
                            Exactly one month after the vinyl, on May 19th there was
                            suddenly a<br>
                            version on CD. An odd record company move in these
                            difficult times for<br>
                            physically published music... Still, the double CD may
                            well serve as the<br>
                            perfect introduction to the Doors because so far, not a
                            single generation<br>
                            has failed to discover the Doors, there's still teenagers
                            out there wearing<br>
                            Jim Morrison t-shirts; they remind me so much of myself
                            25 odd years ago!<br>
                            <br>
