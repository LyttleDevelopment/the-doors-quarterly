        </em>- Bruce Botnick, April 2018.<br>
        <br>
        Not a bad question, actually. Because here we are, in the
        midst of celebrating the Doors as a band, as recording<br>
        and performing artists. It's the 50th Anniversary this
        time around, and surely that calls for a revisiting of
        the band's<br>
        classic albums, in other words: reissues; or does it?
        What's left in the vaults after the outpouring by Bright<br>
        Midnight Archives and the 40th Anniversary CD editions,
        each series providing a wealth of studio outtakes and<br>
        further bonus material? Surely we have had the best of
        the rest by now?...<br>
        Well, let's see what John and Robby, the band management
        and, most notably, engineer / producer Bruce Botnick<br>
        have found under the well settled 50 year old dust this
        time.<br>
        <br>
        Of major concern are the so called 'Rough Mixes' of 9 of
        the 11 songs featured on the original album. Are they
        genuinely<br>
        what Botnick is telling us, near masters, lacking the
        very final touches only, yet interesting and revealing
        enough? And,<br>
        &quot;Who called these dead to dance?&quot;, as Jim would
        come to ask in 'Newborn Awakening'? Well, studio wizard
        Bruce<br>
        Botnick obviously, finder of long lost reels of studio
        outtakes. And I'm glad that he did.<br>
        <br>
        Although, these alternate mixes may not be very
        interesting for the casual spectator. They are not that
        very different<br>
        from the final masters. The seasoned listener on the
        other hand will find what they bargained for, spending
        cash on<br>
        something 'new'. In general, I think it's safe to say
        that the main gain is 'more Jim'. What I mean is that, in
        my opinion,<br>
        the overall sound and musical tracks of these embryonic
        mixes is often mushy, less clear than what we're used to,<br>
        listening to the legendary baby that saw the light of day
        in July of 1968. In general, on the majority of the
        tracks,<br>
        the organ and guitar parts are more prominent, in a
        negative way; too loud. The drums, on the contrary, are
        struggling,<br>
        soft and quiet, lacking the punch of John Densmore's
        unique trademark style. Yet on a positive note: more
        prominent,<br>
        louder and more powerful than ever before, are Jim's
        vocals. Stripped from its echoing sound, as if the man is
        stood right<br>
        by your side, especially when listening through a decent
        set of earphones. Furthermore, the lot is pretty
        insightful, the<br>
        creating process is on display here, and shining it does.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are a few of my findings:<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Hello,
        I Love You</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">: an extended outro, and Ray's singing is
        more prominent;<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Summer's
        Almost Gone</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">: boosts the juxtaposition of the two
        different piano tracks during the instrumental break;<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Spanish
        Caravan</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">: emphasises the duet between Jim's vocal
        and the organ during the latter part, after the
        instrumental<br>
        break, with less sonic effects overall;<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Love
        Street</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">: again, a welcome extended ending to the
        song;<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Wintertime
        Love</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">:
        goes back to the time of the initial vinyl editions of
        Waiting for the Sun. On these, as well as on the<br>
        first round of CD versions, there was a vocal take
        differing from the version of later pressings. It's in
        the way<br>
        Morrison sings &quot;trying (so) desperately to be
        free&quot;... Just compare the song on both CDs in this
        set to get the idea;<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Not
        to Touch the Earth</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">: is rough indeed, with rather annoying
        start &amp; stop moments on both the guitar and drum
        tracks;<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FF8080" size="3" face="Calibri">Five
        to One</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">: yields an ear piercing guitar sound in
        the right hand channel, and there's the very different
        sounding<br>
        &quot;get together one more time&quot; chanting, with the
        band singing along with Jim.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Raw and exciting are 5 unpublished live cuts, apparently
        never bootlegged either, and that's when you know: this
        is<br>
        extremely rare and new! ... From a concert in the Danish
        city of Copenhagen, exactly 50 years ago this evening
        while<br>
        I'm writing this review: September 17th. Cool! Score!
        But, would it not have been grander to just give us the
        entire<br>
        concert instead of the few songs relevant to the album?
        It's annoying incompletion once again, echoing the tiny
        bit<br>
        of Matrix Club recordings that came with last year's </font><font
        color="#FFFF80" size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors 50th
        Anniversary</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri"> box set. A entire difficult episode<br>
        in its own right, the much troubled life and times of the
        Doors' Matrix tapes. But surely the Copenhagen concert as<br>
        featured here could have been presented in its recorded
        entirety?! Not? No, Bruce? Maybe later. Ah!...<br>
        <br>
        Anyway, we should enjoy what's here rather than moan
        about what isn't. Copenhagen 1968 is a great show, with<br>
        Morrison delivering a fiery performance, making up for
        the disaster he caused a few days earlier in Amsterdam;<br>
        missing the gig, being taken away to hospital.<br>
        <br>
        Then of course, lest we not forget the main thing. The
        reason for this new set being around in the first place.<br>
        </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3" face="Calibri">Waiting
        for the Sun</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">, the album. Present here on both vinyl
        and CD, once again newly remastered from the original<br>
        stereo master tapes. No mono this time, unlike what came
        with </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3" face="Calibri">The
        Doors </font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">and</font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3"
        face="Calibri"> Strange Days</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
        size="3" face="Calibri"> Anniversary sets last<br>
        year. Bummer! No less, no more: a bummer! But how great
        does the album sound! Spectacular I'm sure, for those<br>
        owning the latest audio reproducing equipment, as
        explained in detail by Bruce in the booklet; it must be
        quite the<br>
        trip, an expensive one. But to us 'normal Earthlings' the
        thing sounds great, yes indeed: better than ever before.
        It<br>
        does make one wonder: will technology be able to make
        these 'old' recordings sound better still, come 10, 20<br>
        years into the future? Probably, yes. But not to my aging
        ears. What we have here is fabulous enough<br>
        already, so thank you Bruce Botnick!<br>
        <br>
        In packaging this revamped </font><font color="#FFFF80"
        size="3" face="Calibri">Waiting for the Sun</font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">, the band &amp;
        co opted to revisit the concept of the 50th Anniversary<br>
        set of </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3"
        face="Calibri">The Doors</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
        size="3" face="Calibri">, published in January of last
        year. How nice and neat do these two fit together, side
        by side on the<br>
        shelf; twins, for now. It reminds of for instance the
        super deluxe Led Zeppelin box sets, or even Metallica's,
        who<br>
        are also producing Anniversary editions of their classic
        back catalogue. And this exactly is where the Doors got
        it<br>
        wrong, with a missed opportunity to create some sort of
        unity: </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3"
        face="Calibri">Waiting for the Sun</font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri"> is not the
        follow up to </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3"
        face="Calibri">The Doors</font><font color="#FFFFFF"
        size="3" face="Calibri">;<br>
        </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3" face="Calibri">Strange
        Days</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">
        holds the rights to that particular title. And surely,
        yes there was an Anniversary edition of the band's<br>
        sophomore album, but that didn't come packaged the way
        the others do. What a shame. What a pity. Too bad.<br>
        It's hopes up for future 50th Anniversary sets but there
        will forever be the gap where </font><font
        color="#FFFF80" size="3" face="Calibri">Strange Days</font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri"> was due to sit.<br>
        <br>
        Mixed feelings. </font><font color="#FFFF80" size="3"
        face="Calibri">The Doors: Waiting for the Sun</font><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri"> is the stuff
        legends are made of. In honouring its status<br>
        a bust was erected, but not the grand statue it so
        deserves.<br>
