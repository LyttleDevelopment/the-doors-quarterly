                                'Strange Days' ... released in the Fall of 1967, as the Doors'
                                second album,<br>
                                in the wake of that massive number one hit single that
                                helped shape the<br>
                                'Summer of Love': 'Light My Fire' ... Extraordinary! But
                                the Doors were about<br>
                                much more than having their hit song played over the
                                radio on end, a reality<br>
                                brought forward by the debut album, a fact to be stressed
                                by its successor.<br>
                                <br>
                                'Strange Days' ... I could never do a review without
                                getting a tad personal,<br>
                                a step away from what has been written for over 40 years.
                                After all, it is<br>
                                'Strange Days' ...<br>
                                <br>
                                At some point in 1983, 'Strange Days' was the one record
                                that stood out for<br>
                                me from the other music my late father was playing at the
                                time. Although I<br>
                                hungrily picked up on two further albums from psychedelic
                                pop year 1967,<br>
                                somehow it was the Doors' sound that my seven-year-old
                                ears were most<br>
                                gravitated to. The others were 'Their Satanic Majesties
                                Request' by the<br>
                                Rolling Stones, and the Beatles' masterpiece 'Sgt.
                                Pepper's Lonely Hearts<br>
                                Club Band' ... I adored all of it, nothing at all
                                appeared old, weird or<br>
                                uncomfortable about the music on those three albums. But
                                it was 'Strange<br>
                                Days' that found its way into my bedroom the day I got my
                                own first record<br>
                                player, and it just stayed there - I was hooked!<br>
                                <br>
                                Fast forward 32 years and here is this reissue of the
                                rare mono mix, on 180<br>
                                gram vinyl, a limited edition of 12.500 copies released
                                for Record Store Day<br>
                                2015... A very fine product, in keeping with the original
                                1967 artwork as much<br>
                                as possible. Over the many years there have been
                                remasters and re-remasters<br>
                                of the album on both vinyl and compact disc, as well as
                                the '40th Anniversary'<br>
                                remix that made its first appearance on the 'Perception'
                                box set in 2006. What<br>
                                an amazing experience that was, to hear my all time
                                favourite album in this<br>
                                new mix, with features added that had been mixed down for
                                the initial 1967<br>
                                release. Some songs benefit from producer/engineer Bruce
                                Botnick's new<br>
                                take on the album, others don't, but keeping in mind that
                                it wasn't to replace<br>
                                the original master, it was and still is a great way of
                                listening to 'Strange<br>
                                Days' in a different way. Eventually the '40th
                                Anniversary' remix did become<br>
                                the standard master for the classic six studio album
                                catalogue on CD, a fact<br>
                                neither Doors fans nor music fanatics in general are
                                happy about. A totally<br>
                                different issue to be tackled in a future Doors Quarterly
                                feature... It's back to<br>
                                the 2015 reissue for now...<br>
                                <br>
                                Or is it?... Listening to today's mono reissue, many of
                                its assets wouldn't<br>
                                have been this little a surprise had there not been the
                                '40th Anniversary'<br>
                                editions. For example, the handclapping in 'Unhappy Girl'
                                isn't the great<br>
                                revelation it would be for the listener familiar with the
                                original mix only.<br>
                                And so it is for most of the album, there are hardly any
                                surprises left for<br>
                                ears accustomed to the 2006 renovation works. This of
                                course doesn't<br>
                                mean that the record is void of any added quality... On
                                the contrary!<br>
                                Listening back to mono mixes of the 60's through today's
                                equipment<br>
                                is quite revelatory, a field of interest well explored
                                with the larger half<br>
                                of the Beatles' catalogue, its mono mixes reissued and
                                confided to both<br>
                                vinyl and CD box sets in 2009. Footnote: for both the
                                Beatles and the<br>
                                Doors, the production of records in both mono and stereo
                                came to a hold<br>
                                in 1968, disputably the year in which stereo was adopted
                                as the<br>
                                worldwide standard.<br>
                                <br>
                                A brief zooming in on the differences between mono and
                                stereo as far as<br>
                                'Strange Days' goes reveals that 'Love Me Two Times' and
                                'People Are<br>
                                Strange' hardly differ in any way. In mono, the other 8
                                songs have a louder,<br>
                                more upfront sound, more aggressive in places, less
                                subtle and less fragile<br>
                                where deemed appropriate. &quot;You're Lost Little
                                Girl&quot; puts extra emphasis on<br>
                                Robby Krieger's wailing, weeping guitar sound,
                                &quot;Unhappy Girl&quot; has the<br>
                                aforementioned handclapping, and the sound effects on
                                &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot;<br>
                                are louder, giving the piece an extra bit of dramatic
                                kick. Perhaps the track<br>
                                that benefits most from the mono overhaul is 'My Eyes
                                Have Seen You'. With<br>
                                both a slightly different bass opening and fade-out, the
                                instruments fly from<br>
                                the speakers to hit you straight in the face! Closing
                                track &quot;When the Music's<br>
                                Over&quot; has these different, often extra nuances that
                                make it very worthwile<br>
                                listening to as a twin brother to its stereo version.<br>
                                <br>
                                To wrap things up... Does 'Strange Days' in mono come
                                with a vast array of<br>
                                surprises? No, it doesn't. Is it worth picking up, and
                                would I recommend it?<br>
                                Yes absolutely! Although probably for collectors and
                                completists, for<br>
                                audiophiles and lovers of the monaural sound only, any
                                serious fan of the<br>
                                Doors should hear the album like this at least once!<br>
                                <br>
                                Hopes are high for Record Store Day 2016... May
                                Elektra/Rhino consider<br>
                                giving &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; the same
                                treatment. The mono master has<br>
                                the rare alternate 'Wintertime Love' with a different
                                vocal track.<br>
