        face="Calibri">DQ #29 was a kind of anniversary issue for
        the The Doors Quarterly - it was celebrating its<br>
        10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Nobody had believed the
        magazine would last that long - 29 issues in<br>
        10 years, not bad, I thought.<br>
        <br>
        And 1993 was a pretty good year - meeting Ray Manzarek in
        L.A., Frank and Kathy Lisciandro<br>
        in Santa Barbara and Patricia Kennealy-Morrison in New
        York, and filming all three of them for<br>
        TV interviews (they were used in quite a few TV Specials)
        ... hey, that was great! I also met<br>
        Robby at his house in the canyon and attended a concert
        of him and his band in Costa Mesa,<br>
        California. I also saw The Soft Parade in Asbury Park,
        New Jersey, and took a flight to San<br>
        Francisco where I met Jello Biafra of The Dead Kennedys
        for an interview ... what a fantastic<br>
        summer it was!<br>
        <br>
        Finally, a 64-page DQ #29 came out, telling fanclub
        members all the stories, great news and<br>
        all activities from creative people around The Doors.
        Check for yourself - news and gossip,<br>
        book/CD reviews, concert reviews, Dan Salomon&#146;s
        revealing chronology of the night<br>
        Pamela Courson died (this article includes rare
        documents), my interview with Gilles<br>
        Yepremian, an early version of my Paris Guide, a project
        I did with Patricia Kennealy-Morrison<br>
        (Fans asking her questions) plus some reproductions of
        concert posters including a 4-line<br>
        poem handwritten by Jim Morrison - could a fan in 1993
        expect more?<br>
        <br>
        Have fun reading the digital version of The Doors
        Quarterly 29!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all.<br>
        <br>

        And don&#146;t forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 29 hasn't been altered<br>
        in any way. You get it as it was published on September
        26, 1993 (!). Be aware that all<br>
        addresses (private, phone, email and web) are no longer
        valid. Books, CDs or posters and<br>
        other stuff might not be available anymore. Please do not
        respond to any of the small ads or<br>
        blame anyone for incorrect details - all writers just did
        the best they could back in 1993.<br>
        <br>
        And ... please do NOT reply to Freddy Tornberg&#146;s ad
        on page 21 - Freddy is not with us<br>
        anymore, he died on December 25, 2010 aged 65.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital issue and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by<br>
        publishing a digital version of DQ #28.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
