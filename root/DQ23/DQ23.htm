        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #23
        got published on June 5, 1990, and everyone<br>
        (including myself) was desperately waiting for more news
        on The Doors' movie at<br>
        that time - better said, Oliver Stone's movie. Please
        read the news section in DQ 23<br>
        to see how carefully I was collecting all those rumors
        and correct information floating<br>
        among the media and the fans. Those news bits published
        in DQ 23 were the ones<br>
        I was allowed to tell in the magazine - one thing I could
        not mention was the fact<br>
        that Ray Manzarek was literally thrown off the movie set.
        He was trying to control<br>
        the process of filming and interfering too much (in
        Stone's eyes) --- and Ray never<br>
        was happy with any of the different versions of the movie
        script. No wonder most<br>
        fans at that time were disappointed about the movie -
        wonder how it would have<br>
        turned out to be if they had admitted more of Ray's ideas
        ... by the way, Oliver<br>
        Stone's office called me for a full cassette tape of The
        Doors' Miami show, which I<br>
        (of course) mailed to them quickly.<br>
        <br>
        Further news of June 1990 - just open page 3-5 of your
        digital DQ #23.<br>
        <br>
        Check part 1 of my &quot;LA Tours&quot;, a guide to The
        Doors' Los Angeles that is still helpful<br>
        for fans visiting this incredible city. Carefully read
        the &#147;From you to me&#148; letters and<br>
        be surprised about Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's very
        different view on the<br>
        forthcoming Doors-movie. By the way, she changed her mind
        on that after watching<br>
        the movie.<br>
        Enjoy June 1990's latest bootleg reviews - just one vinyl
        double album called<br>
        &quot;Celebration - Some Are Born to Sweet Delight&quot;
        and seven single albums on vinyl.<br>
        Former club member Jay Burnstein wrote a review on a
        Krieger/Burdon concert<br>
        and also sent me an insightful interview with Ray
        Manzarek on his band Nite City.<br>
        Ko Lankester did an article called &quot;Love, Death
        &amp; Resurrection&quot; (part two is in DQ 24)<br>
        exploring Jim Morrison's lyrics, followed by a
        &quot;Who's who&quot; line-up on the musicians<br>
        who joined The Doors on their recordings.<br>
        <br>
        All this came on glossy paper in pretty neat printing
        quality - let's not forget the free<br>
        colour poster accompanying the magazine - a nice huge
        photo of The Doors in a<br>
        Frankfurt photo studio (no longer available, sorry!).<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital copy and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon<br>
        by publishing the digital version of DQ 22.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        <br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>

        <br>
        And don&#146;t forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 23 hasn't been<br>
        altered in any way. You get it as it was published on
        June 5, 1990 (!). Be aware that all<br>
        addresses (private, phone) are no longer valid. Books,
        vinyl discs, CDs or posters and<br>
        other stuff might not be available anymore. Please do not
        respond to any of the small<br>
        ads or blame anyone for incorrect details - all writers
        just did the best they could back<br>
        in 1990. And all this happened without any emails and
        therefore without the internet.<br>
        <br>
