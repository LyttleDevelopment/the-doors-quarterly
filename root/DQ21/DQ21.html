        Quarterly #21 was published in the fall of 1989, shortly
        after I had returned from<br>
        my second trip to Los Angeles where I had met (how I
        called it) 'The Doors family': I taped<br>
        interviews with Robby Krieger, John Densmore and Danny
        Sugerman in L.A., and with Frank<br>
        &amp; Kathy Lisciandro in Santa Barbara. I met Ray Paret
        and Linda Kyriazi (who worked for<br>
        Robby Krieger) and Rich Linnell, one of The Doors' former
        promoters plus a few other nice<br>
        and helpful people. I visited Henry Diltz at his house in
        North Hollywood and saw a great<br>
        'Wild Child' concert at the Roxy on the Sunset Strip.<br>
        <br>
        What an unforgettable trip that was including all the
        sights a Doors fan has to see!<br>
        Check the travel report my ex wife wrote for this DQ #21.<br>
        <br>
        Check part three of my Robby Krieger interview, as well
        as an extended review of the<br>
        famous &quot;Rock is Dead&quot; vinyl bootleg along with
        &quot;Copulations&quot;, the first vinyl including<br>
        songs from the Toronto Pop Festival in 1969. Furthermore,
        I complain about Italian<br>
        bootleg CDs (made from vinyl bootlegs). Then you might
        want to check the first ever<br>
        attempt to transcribe a tape of The Doors' Miami concert
        and an excellent article<br>
        (interview) on Ray's keyboard equipment and his skills
        taken from 'Modern Keyboard',<br>
        March 1989.<br>
        <br>
        'Peering through the keyhole into the future' is an
        article on The Doors from yesteryear<br>
        (date and source unknown). Also Jim's first Elektra
        Records biography sheet is to be<br>
        seen in this DQ (note: I added my old address at the
        bottom, sorry! How could I?!).<br>
        <br>
        For DQ #21, Doors fan Ko Lankester provided the first
        part of his interview with Patricia<br>
        Kennealy-Morrison, and I myself couldn't resist writing a
        review of the 'Wild Child'<br>
        show at the Roxy on July 3rd, 1989.<br>
        <br>
        There wasn't the usual free poster but certainly #21 did
        come with a fine new golden<br>
        bumper sticker. Enjoy your digital version and let us
        know what you think ... we will<br>
        continue soon by publishing a digital version of DQ 20.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 21 hasn't been<br>
        altered in any way. You get it as it was published in the
        fall of 1989 (!). Be aware that<br>
        all addresses (private, phone) are certainly no longer
        valid (including the contact<br>
        address for Henry Diltz). Books, vinyl albums, CDs or
        posters and other stuff might<br>
        not be available any longer. Please do not respond to any
        of the small ads or blame<br>
        anyone for incorrect details - all writers just did the
        best they could back in 1989.<br>
        <br>
        And all this happened without any computers or emails and
        of course, without<br>
        the internet. Everything got typed on an electric
        typewriter and the bigger letters for<br>
        headings used to be rub-off letters on small plastic
        sheets.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly<br>
        Magazine 21, be aware that we only have very few copies
        left!<br>
        <br>
        Thank you!<br>
