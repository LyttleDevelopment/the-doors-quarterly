        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #28
        was published on March 20, 1993 and presented<br>
        a very special cover photo for the fans: Jim Morrison at
        the Jazz &amp; Pop office in New<br>
        York, by Janice Coughlan, around June 1970. Patricia
        Kennealy-Morrison had sent me<br>
        an original print of this photo along with her kind
        permission to put it into the DQ.<br>
        Into? No, instead of putting it &#147;into&#148; I
        decided to place the photo onto DQ 28&#146;s very<br>
        front page ;-)<br>
        <br>
        Talking about Patricia - she got a whopping 8 pages in
        #28 for a long letter she wrote<br>
        and the Q&amp;A she did for my readers (part two in DQ
        29). Most interesting question<br>
        came from Beatrice (France) - why Pam was going to Paris
        with Jim and not Patricia.<br>
        Read PKM&#146;s surprising answer on page 16. She also
        tells Beatrice in detail about the<br>
        mysterious photos on the back of the book STRANGE DAYS.<br>
        <br>
        You&#146;ll also find part 5 of an LA guide for Doors
        fans in this issue - this part was<br>
        written by a guy who I do not have contact with anymore.
        Check the great mix of<br>
        (then) new books, new official and unofficial CD releases
        (vinyl was practically<br>
        dead in &#146;93), most important of all (in my opinion)
        used to be the LIVE IN MIAMI CD.<br>
        <br>
        Pity - although I sent a couple of fans&#146; questions
        to Jerry Hopkins (as announced<br>
        on page 35), he never found the time to answer them ...<br>
        <br>
        The more we step back into time with those early issues
        of the magazine, the<br>
        stranger it gets to check those ancient articles and
        reviews ... and sometimes I<br>
        wonder why I still agree in 2015 to most I had written at
        that time in 1993,<br>
        22 years ago!<br>
        <br>
        At the time of this DQ I received a personal letter from
        Albert Goldman, infamous<br>
        author and journalist, who was busy writing a book on Jim
        Morrison including the<br>
        topics - Jim was abused by his mother at young age and
        had sex with her, Jim<br>
        committed suicide in Paris ... Albert was about sending
        me some final chapters of<br>
        that forthcoming book just to see what I was thinking.
        Unfortunately he died a year<br>
        later in March of 1994 - and the stuff he was writing
        will probably never see the<br>
        light of day.<br>
        <br>
        Final quote comes from Roger Daltrey, singer of The Who,
        about Oliver Stone&#146;s<br>
        Doors movie: &#147;<i>I knew Jim Morrison personally -
        and this film was totally shitty. It<br>
        had nothing to do with the truth</i>.&#148; Thanks,
        Roger, but still many fans believe<br>
        in Oliver&#146;s fantasies ...<br>
        <br>
        Have fun reading the digital version of The Doors
        Quarterly 28!<br>
        <br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all.<br>

        And don&#146;t forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly

        altered in any way. You get it as it was published on
        March 20, 1993 (!). Be aware<br>
        that all addresses (private, phone, email and web) are no
        longer valid. Books, CDs<br>

        anymore. Please do not respond<br>
        to any of the small ads or blame anyone for incorrect
        details - all writers just did<br>
        the best they could back in 1992/'93.<br>
        <br>
        And - if you&#146;re interested in Grant Jacob&#146;s
        photos of Jim Morrison?<br>
        Prints of 11x14 are available for $500.00 each in 2015
        (check page 36 of<br>
        DQ 28 - way back in 1993 they were $50 each) ...<br>
        <br>
