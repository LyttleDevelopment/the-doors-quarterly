        the main focus is (p. 24-26) Ray Manzarek<br>
        in Berlin - August 30 &amp; 31, 1991 - a day I will never
        forget. Please read my report<br>
        on traveling to Berlin just because of Ray appearing on
        German TV for a ZDF-Show<br>
        called &#147;Idols&#147;, hosted by Thomas Gottschalk and
        Günther Jauch. Yes, many celebrities<br>
        were there, Julian Lennon, the German president Richard
        von Weizsäcker, Nena, Boy<br>
        George, just to name a few. Being invited to that show
        meant &#147;Backstage - Access<br>
        All Areas&#148;, and I enjoyed walking around there
        talking to a few famous people ...<br>
        but my main focus was on watching Ray. Gosh, what a
        night! And the day after - talking<br>
        to Ray and Dorothy in their hotel, talking to Thomas
        Gottschalk and Günther Jauch<br>
        (both very famous in Germany), helping them with the
        questions they were planning<br>
        to ask Ray - WOW.<br>
        <br>
        <b>DOES ANYBODY HAVE A VIDEO RECORDING OF THAT SHOW? I
        have lost my own<br>
        recording, and even the ZDF DOES NOT HAVE A COPY, somehow
        they missed<br>
        taping it. They are asking for a copy &#150; let me know,
        I&#146;ll pass your VHS copy to the<br>
        right people at their archives &#150; be sure,
        you&#146;ll get back your cassette, plus a<br>
        digital version of it.<br>
        <br>
        </b>Otherwise find useful information. <i>The Doors
        Quarterly Magazine</i> became known for<br>
        (at that time - February 1992) - a lot of news (f.e. Jim
        Morrison allegedly buried in<br>
        the north of Germany, John&#146;s Spoken Word edition of
        his book, the authentic sofa (!)<br>
        from The Doors&#146; office ...), Part Three of my
        Doors&#146; L.A. Guide (Sunset Boulevard,<br>
        Hollywood Bowl, Griffith Observatory, Laurel Canyon, plus
        more. Also added: a fine list<br>
        of all German 7&#148; vinyl releases plus the usual
        reviews of videos, bootlegs, official<br>
        releases and books. Check the nice article on how Paul
        Rothchild found out HOW BAD<br>
        Doors&#146; CDs were way back at that time (page 33), and
        you&#146;ll probably love Dan<br>
        Salomon&#146;s article on L.A. Woman. You&#146;ll surely
        enjoy Ko Lankester&#146;s thoughts on<br>
        <i>Love, Death and Resurrection</i> in this Doors
        Quarterly Magazine #25.<br>
        There wasn&#146;t a free poster with this issue.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon<br>
        by publishing a digital version of DQ 24.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
