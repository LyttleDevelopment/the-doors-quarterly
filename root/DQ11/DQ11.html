        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #11
        was published on July 25, 1986. The publishing
        &quot;devoted itself entirely to The Doors&quot;, Danny
        Sugerman wrote<br>
        to fans consulting him for new information on the band.
        That's why we got quite a few new subscribers in the USA.<br>
        The cover of this issue was sent in by Osamu Nozawa from
        Japan, a devoted Doors collector then and now still.<br>
        <br>
        Still the talk of town was the Doors film - this June
        Randy Johnson got chosen as director and a new working
        title was said to be 'Riders on the<br>
        Storm'. Fortunately John Travolta wasn't going to star as
        Jim Morrison, although the script had already been
        finished. I wonder how good or bad<br>
        that script was, and how much Oliver Stone used from it
        later; or how much got deleted.<br>
        <br>
        Fine news from Robby. In an interview he said, &quot;We
        were at Sunset Sounds recording our first LP, when the
        door opened and The Beatles came in,<br>
        they were just doing their final American concerts, and
        they were hanging 'round the studio.&quot; That could
        have been a nice jam session ... Well,<br>
        whenever musicians meet and there are instruments around
        they do a jam session, right?<br>
        One can only imagine ... The Beatles and The Doors ...
        God only knows what is still in The Doors archives.<br>
        <br>
        I still like the collection of interview snippets, which
        some fan had collected and sent to us. Unfortunately the
        sources were not added, but pages<br>
        12 to 15 still make a good read ... I called it, 'Love it
        or leave it' ... read what happened on July 3rd 1986 ...
        for the first time fans got thrown off the<br>
        cemetery by the police. Check the video of that day,
        which I shot and uploaded to YouTube many years later.
        Its title is 'Jim Morrison's grave in<br>
        Paris, Père Lachaise, July 3, 1986' and the link is
        featured at the bottom of this introduction.<br>
        <br>
        A collection of articles on 'Other Voices' follows, and
        Patricia Devaux (deceased) appreciated the video 'Dance
        on Fire' in her tribute in French<br>
        called 'Dance on Fire: Une Appreciation'. I contributed a
        review of 'The Definitely Complete Doors Songbook', at
        the time in 1986 this book was<br>
        everybody's must-have. DQ 11 closes with a poem by Hlrich
        Heumann (deceased), a true collector and personal friend
        for many years. <br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 11 hasn't been altered in any way. You get it as
        it was published in the<br>
        summer of 1986 (!). Be aware that all addresses (private,
        phone) are certainly no longer valid. Books, vinyl
        records and other stuff might not<br>
        be available anymore. Please do not respond to any of the
        small ads or blame anyone for incorrect details - all
        writers just did the best they<br>
        could do back in early 1986. And all this happened
        without any computers, no emails and of course without
        the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 11 I must tell you
        that there are no copies left at all!<br>
        Thank you! <br>
