        very busy checking record fairs, flea markets and<br>
        collectors&#146; magazines for Doors records I did not
        own, and I tell you, those Doors discs<br>
        at the time were pretty cheap. That&#146;s why I decided
        to put a few rare Doors 45s on the<br>
        front page &#150; and along came The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine # 31, showing the four<br>
        7&#147; singles from the album THE SOFT PARADE (including
        WHO SCARED YOU as the flip<br>
        side of WISHFUL SINFUL, which did not make it to an album
        release until WEIRD SCENES<br>
        INSIDE THE GOLDMINE). The fans loved the front page and
        asked for more.<br>

        It was the second issue that I mailed from the
        Netherlands (the postage they asked for<br>
        sending the DQ to other European countries and overseas
        was MUCH less than they used<br>
        to do in Germany, and The Netherlands are just a 20
        minute ride by car from my town<br>
        in Germany). Strangely enough, that was not only cheaper
        but more reliable &#150; less magazines<br>
        got stolen on their way to the fans, and they arrived
        even faster than before.<br>

        A lot of news (5 pages) in this issue &#150; most
        important of all was the discovery of the<br>
        &#147;Lost Paris Tapes&#147;. A guy had contacted me by
        phone &#150; read the surprising article I<br>
        wrote about THE PARIS TAPES OF JIM MORRISON and my
        meeting with that guy in Paris.<br>

        What follows in issue #31 is the usual mix of CD &#150;
        Vinyl - book reviews, concert reviews,<br>
        check them all! Most &#147;letters to the editor&#147;
        are about an article Patricia Kennealy-Morrison<br>
        had written for DQ 30 &#150; wait for this issue to build
        your own point of view.<br>

        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly

        in any way. You get it as it was published on December 1,
        1994. Be aware that all<br>
        addresses (private, phone, email and web) are no longer
        valid. Books, CDs or posters and<br>
        other stuff might not be available anymore. Please do not
        respond to any of the small ads or<br>
