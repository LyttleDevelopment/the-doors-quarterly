                The Doors Quarterly Magazine was founded in 1983 by long time Doors fan
                Rainer Moddemann. In fact it was Ray Manzarek who brought up the
                idea of starting a fanclub,<br>
                realising that Rainer was among the world's top collectors and
                connoisseurs of all things Doors.<br>
                <br>
                Starting with a small but dedicated group of followers, the
                magazine soon found growth in both recognition and quality.
                Always a unique source of first hand news and<br>
                information, its exclusiveness never failed to amaze Doors fans
                in those long gone days before the internet was a fact. The DQ
                became a world wide renowned publication,<br>
                much loved for its insightful mixture of interviews, articles,
                reviews, photos, news and so on. If it only even remotedly
                concerned the Doors, the Quarterly would be on top of<br>
                it and Doors people would know. The DQ was a most reliable
                critique, telling collectors exactly what was hot and what was
                not.<br>
                <br>
                Despite the unstoppable growth of and increasing interest in the
                club and magazine throughout the Nineties, by the end of the
                decade costs for publishing and shipping had risen<br>
                seriously. Besides that, there now was this unstoppable force
                called the world wide web, news was being spread at lightning
                speed and everything became available at the blink<br>
                of an eye. Before the turn of the Millennium, DQ #37 wrapped
                things up in June of 1999 - sad but true.<br>
                <br>
                Sometime in 2012 I messaged Rainer on Facebook and told him about
                my ideas of resurrecting the DQ, online. The magazines could be
                digitised, made available for all to download<br>
                and (re)discover the world's longest running and finest Doors
                fanzine ever; and still we could do so much more... Much to my
                delight Rainer agreed and this is exactly what you are<br>
                looking at now: welcome to &quot;The Doors Quarterly Magazine
                Online,&quot; a tribute to a legend.
