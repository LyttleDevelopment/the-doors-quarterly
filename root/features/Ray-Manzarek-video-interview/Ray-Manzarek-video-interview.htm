        call from a director asking if I had time to do an
        interview with Ray for a few TV features<br>
        planned for Jim Morrison&#146;s 50th Birthday. Of course
        I agreed. I called Ray if he had time, and a few days
        later I<br>
        got a flight ticket from the TV company. Ray was pretty
        busy at that time and let me know that he had just half<br>
        an hour left before he had to leave. In fact he was
        anxiously waiting for a phone call. So I tried my best to
        keep<br>
        my questions precisely on what the director had told me.<br>

                <td valign="top"><font color="#FFFFFF">The last
                performance we ever gave as a band, all four of
                us, John, Ray, Jim and Robby, was in New Orleans
                in 1971, and it was perhaps<br>
                not the best concert we've ever played &#133; the
                night before however we had just played in Texas,
                I forget Dallas or Houston, one or the<br>
                other, and it was absolutely brilliant. We played
                'Riders on the Storm<i>'</i> for the first time,
                and he was absolutely amazing. And I remember<br>
                after the concert, Vince Treanor, our roadie,
                came up to us and said, &#147;<i>What was that
                song? I've never heard that song before!</i>&#148;<br>
                And I said, &#147;<i>That is the new one we're
                working on for the album and it's called 'Riders
                on the Storm'.</i>&#148; And he said, &#147;<i>I
                love that<br>
                piece, Ray. That is absolutely incredible!</i>&#148;
                So the fact that we've got to play that one song,
                'Riders on the Storm', one time was one of<br>
                the great joys of my life and unfortunately we
                never got to do it again with Jim. He decided to
                leave the planet on July 3<sup>rd</sup>. And the
                next<br>
                night the concert in New Orleans was less than
                one of our best concerts, and I've never seen Jim
                get so tired so quickly. He was great in,<br>
                ah, great in Texas, and in the next night or the
                night after, there might have been a day in
                between, I don't even think so, he was extremely<br>
                tired, and I've never seen him that tired before
                because he always had a great energy about him
                and a great excitement about him. And he<br>
                would always feel the energy coming off of him,
                but that night it was as if his energy had just
                left him, and there was a point in one of the<br>
                pieces where we were playing &#133; and most of
                the times I would play with my head down and
                listening to John, listening to Robby on the<br>
                far end, Jim in the middle and I would
                concentrate with my head down. And I heard &#133;
                we were in the middle of one of our solos, and I<br>
                forget what it was exactly, but I thought Jim had
                left the stage. And I thought, &#147;That is odd,
                he shouldn't be leaving the stage!&#148;
                Sometimes<br>
                he would leave the stage in 'Light my Fire',
                because the song would go on so long and it would
                be a nice chance for him to go offstage,<br>
                get a beer, relax, come back, sit down, shake a
                maraca and wait until it was time for Jim to sing
                again. But this time he &#133; ah, he had left<br>
                the stage in a song that he shouldn't have left
                the stage. And I thought, &#147;<i>What's that?
                Jim is gone!</i>&#148; And I looked up, and he
                was still<br>
                standing. Center stage, holding on to the
                microphone. It was as if the essence of Jim
                Morrison, the spirit of Jim Morrison had left his
                body.<br>
                The body was there, but the spirit of the man had
                gone. And that was the last concert we've ever
                played together.</font></td>

                he said &#133; we were working on L. A. Woman of

                much done except we had mixes yet to do. And Jim
                said, &#147;<i>Why don't you guys go ahead and
                finish up the mixes? You could do it<br>

                and could either renegotiate with Elektra or sign
                up with a new record company.<br>
                We could do anything we wanted, we were
                completely free at that point. And Jim decided to
                take an extended vacation. And when he<br>
                said 'Paris' I thought that was the best thing he
                could possibly do, unbeknownst then to me what
                would happen to him. I thought, 'An<br>
                American in Paris', Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Henry
                Miller, all the great American writers who had
                gone to Paris and I thought this was<br>
                absolutely perfect. Get away from Los Angeles,
                get away from Rock'n'Roll, get away from America,
                and recapture the muse, seduce<br>
                the lady, seduce the muse to come back and bless
                you with her inspiration so that Jim could regain
                his round as &#133; not as a rock star<br>
                but as a poet &#150; that was the important
                thing. The Jim Morrison - for me, for John and
                for Robby was always a poet. The rock star thing<br>
                was incidental to us, that came only later. The
                Doors were never set up to be rock stars. We of
                course wanted to play big venues, and<br>
                play for lots of people, but as a rock star then,
                you know &#133; Rock'nRoll stars in a rock band
                &#133; kings of acid rock, and Jim as the<br>
                'Lizard King', kings of orgasmic rock &#150; we
                never wanted any of that. We wanted Jim to be
                accepted as a poet, The Doors to be<br>
                accepted as musicians, jazz-rock musicians. And
                Jim had, because of all the pressure and all the
                problems with his life and with Rock 'n'<br>
                Roll and Miami and everything that was going on
                with his life &#133; I thought the best thing in
                the world for him was to get away, go to<br>
                Paris, capture the muse and stay there as long as
                you want. When I asked him, &#147;<i>How long do
                you wanna stay?</i>&#148;, he said, &#147;<i>I
                don't<br>
                know, three months, six months, I don't know.</i>&#148;
                I said, &#147;<i>Good! Six months? Fine! You
                know, the album's gonna be coming out,<br>
                we don't have anything to do, go ahead and do
                that, you know.</i>&#148; And that was the last I
                ever saw of Jim Morrison. He was off to<br>
                Paris to begin writing poetry again, to compile
                his notes from Miami &#150; he said he was going
                to finally write that book of all the notes<br>
                that he had written in Miami &#133;</font></td>

                Yeah, concerning our favorite band! (<i>laughs</i>)
                And our favorite lead singer! So anyway, aemmm,
                Jim had decided to go to<br>
                Paris to take a long vacation, three months, six
                months, however long it took for him to relax, to
                begin to write again, to work on his<br>
                poetry, to work on the notes that he took in
                Miami, to compile a novel &#133; I was very
                excited about that. It was a novel like &#133;
                there<br>
                was a French writer in 1830, 1835 who came to
                America, Alexis de Tocqueville, who wrote
                'Democracy in America', but Jim was<br>
                going to write 'Observations on America while on
                Trial in Miami for Obscenity', and I thought,
                &#147;<i>Perfect!</i>&#148;, because Jim would
                write<br>
                just a great book about his observations about
                America, what it meant to be an American. And
                that's what he was going to do in<br>
                Paris, and to the best of my knowledge I don't
                think he ever got started on the 'Observations on
                America' but he did write a lot of<br>
                poetry while he was in Paris, and some of that
                poetry has surfaced in a sealed box, '127
                Fascination', as it was written on the edge<br>
                of the box, and I know the fellows in San
                Francisco who purchased the box, and I saw the
                poetry. And it's Jim Morrison's poetry<br>
                that he wrote in Paris, it's some very good
                stuff. Some of it has been subsequently
                published. Ah, Frank and Corky put a book<br>
                together, and, ah, couple of books together, and,
                ah, using bits and pieces of the poetry, but it
                would have been nice just to see the<br>
                poetry just as it is, just ... don't edit it, it
                doesn't need to be edited, or if it does need to
                be edited, just a very slight amount of editing,<br>
                but just put the poetry together just the way I
                saw it in this box ... and I opened this box and
                I saw all of his poetry, I was flabbergasted,<br>
                I thought it was wonderful. Jim was writing in
                Paris, Jim was working in Paris, and that was the
                best thing. He was trying to ... he was<br>
                being a poet again which is something I don't
                think he really had that much of an opportunity
                to do in the last year here in Los Angeles,<br>
                although he was able to come over with songs for
                L. A. Woman. But as far as his actual writing
                poetry I don't know how much poetry<br>
                he worked on here in L. A. ... and he got to
                Paris and he got started all over again, and the
                tragedy of the whole story is that Jim died<br>
                on July 3<sup>rd</sup> 1971 in Paris, and that
                Pam died not long after that, a few years later,
                and Pam was dead, too. A Romeo &amp; Juliet
                story,<br>
                and, ah, two very lovely American people dead, a
                real tragedy.</font></td>

                Alright. On July 3<sup>rd</sup> 1971 Jim Morrison
                passed into the ether, left upward into the loam.
                On July 4<sup>th</sup> or perhaps the 5<sup>th</sup>,<br>
                I can't be sure which day it was ... Dorothy and
                I were having breakfast, and a phone call came
                from Bill Siddons saying, &#147;<i>I have<br>
                some bad news &#150; Jim is dead!</i>&#148; I
                said, &#147;<i>Well, wait a minute, I've heard
                the story before!</i>&#148; Paul is dead was a
                notorious thing<br>
                that was going on at that time, Paul McCartney of
                The Beatles. Jim, I've heard, had died three or
                four times. We were at a party,<br>
                someone came into the party and said, &#147;<i>Oh
                my God, Jim Morrison is dead!</i>&#148; And we
                said, &#147;<i>What, what, what, what?</i>&#148;
                Five<br>
                minutes later in walked Jim. We said, &#147;<i>Hey,
                man, I thought you were ... you're supposed to be
                dead!</i>&#148; And as Mark Twain said,<br>
                Jim said, &#147;<i>No, the stories of my death
                have been greatly exaggerated.</i>&#148; And we
                all laughed, ah, it happened a couple of other<br>
                times, too, in which Jim was dead and of course
                he wasn't dead. So this is the same sort of
                story, Jim is dead, and I said, &#147;<i>Bill,<br>
                come on, you know, I've heard that story before!</i>&#148;
                And he said, &#147;<i>No, no, no, this time I
                think it's serious.</i>&#148; I said, &#147;<i>What?</i>&#148;<br>
                &#147;He said, &#147;<i>I've talked to Pam and
                she was all broken up!</i>&#148; I said, &#147;<i>Well,
                good Lord! What happened?</i>&#148; He said,
                &#147;<i>I don't know!</i>&#148;<br>
                &#147;<i>Was it an accident? Hit by a car? What
                happened?</i>&#148; He said, &#147;<i>I don't
                know what happened, she wouldn't say.</i>&#148; I
                said, &#147;<i>Well,<br>
                why don't you go?</i>&#148; He said, &#147;<i>I
                am. I'll get over there. I have a flight, twelve
                o'clock.</i>&#148; Or something like that. It
                might have<br>
                been eight, nine, ten o'clock in the morning.
                &#147;<i>I have a twelve o'clock flight booked,
                non-stop, from Los Angeles to Paris.</i>&#148; I
                said,<br>
                &#147;<i>Good. Get over there, find out what's
                going on and call me as soon as you get over
                there.</i>&#148; Well, I didn't hear from him for<br>
                two days. He called me back and he said, &#147;<i>Ray,
                this is Bill.</i>&#148; I said, &#147;<i>Where
                are you?</i>&#148; He said, &#147;<i>I'm in
                Paris.</i>&#148; I said, &#147;<i>Well, what<br>
                happened?</i>&#148; He said, &#147;<i>We buried
                Jim this morning</i>.&#148; &#147;<i>What?</i>&#148;
                &#147;<i>We buried Jim this morning!</i>&#148; I
                said - and he mentioned Père<br>
                Lachaise cemetery which I wasn't aware of at that
                time, and I said, &#147;<i>Who was there?</i>&#148;
                &#147;<i>Just a few people, Pam was there ...</i>&#148;,<br>
                and I said, &#147;<i>Oh my God, what happened?</i>&#148;
                He said, &#147;<i>Well, I guess it was a heart
                attack or something</i>.&#148; I said, &#147;<i>Well,
                how did<br>
                he look, what ...</i>?&#148; He said, &#147;<i>I
                don't know.</i>&#148; I said, &#147;<i>What do
                you mean you don't know how he looked? I mean,
                did you bury<br>
                Jim? How did he look?</i>&#147; Bill said, &#147;<i>I
                never saw the body. Jim was in a sealed coffin.</i>&#148;
                I said, &#147;<i>Wait a minute. You&#146;re
                telling<br>
                me you put Jim in a sealed coffin in the ground
                in a cemetery in Paris and Jim Morrison is
                supposed to be in there?</i>&#148; He said,<br>
                &#147;<i>He is in there. I know he is in there</i>.&#148;
                I sat there and thought that doesn&#146;t make
                any sense. Quite frankly, it doesn&#146;t make
                ANY<br>
                sense. &#147;<i>That&#146;s not what you&#146;re
                supposed to do. You&#146;re supposed to find out
                what happened. Jim died of a heart attack?
                He&#146;s<br>
                27 years old. 27-year-old men don&#146;t die of a
                heart attack. Granted, he was not in the best of
                shape, but 27-year-olds don&#146;t<br>
                die of a heart attack and how do you know
                he&#146;s in the coffin?</i>&#148; He said,
                &#147;<i>Well, Pam was so upset - I couldn&#146;t
                ask to open the<br>
                coffin and see the body and that to this day is
                all I know of what happened to Jim Morrison in
                Paris</i>.&#148;</font></td>

                all of that technical and legal nonsense was
                taken care of, the three of us just sort of
                flopped back in our chairs in the office,<br>
                opened a beer and said, &#147;<i>Holy cow, God,
                what happened to Jim? What a loss. What a
                tragedy. Now what? What do we do?</i>&#148;<br>
                At the time we had been rehearsing, working on
                songs. Robby was bringing in songs. I was
                beginning to write some songs. Gosh,<br>
                Robby had &#145;Ships With Sails&#146;. We had
                been working on the song &#145;Ships With
                Sails&#146;. It would have been wonderful to hear
                Jim sing<br>
                &#145;Ships With Sails&#146; and I think Robby
                also had &#145;Wandering Musician&#146;, so we
                were doing while Jim was writing his poetry,
                doing what<br>
                he did, we were doing what we do, working on some
                new material two to three times a week, getting
                together in the afternoon,<br>
                waiting for Jim to come back, just working on a
                batch of new songs and we just decided, &#147;<i>What
                can we do? Let&#146;s just continue<br>
                doing what we do, making music. Jim was writing
                songs as we have since we found out and we were
                working on our own<br>
                music, so let&#146;s just continue making music.
                What should we do? Should we get a new singer?</i>&#148;
                We thought about getting a new<br>
                singer, but at this time, the idea sounded absurd
                &#133; to bring someone in, someone to replace
                Jim Morrison was a ridiculous idea. &#147;<i>We<br>
                can&#146;t. The Doors are the four of us. Even
                without Jim, we are still The Doors, so we will
                continue as The Doors</i>.&#148; To bring in<br>
                someone else would be totally absurd.
                Consequently, we never did bring in a lead singer
                and we made two albums as The Doors.<br>
                After &#145;Other Voices&#146; and &#145;Full
                Circle&#146; we decided to close The Doors. It
                was time for that part of our lives to come to an
                end. I miss<br>
                him very much and I know John and Robby miss him
                very, very much. He was a great friend and even
                better, he was a great artist and<br>
                a great poet. That&#146;s what I remember Jim as
                a great poet, great artist and a very good
                friend.</font></td>

                I said, &#147;<i>No, no, no. Jim was in Paris.
                Pam was in Paris</i>.&#148; And I think what
                might have happened is Alain Ronay was in Paris<br>
                and someone said &#145;Alan&#146;. You know

                Ronay and this person probably thought that<br>
                Alain was Alan Graham. No, no. There was an Alan
                there, but it was Alain Ronay and that&#146;s how

                I did hear the story of some extra strong heroin

                know that Pam died of an overdose. You know
                that&#146;s not news to anybody that Pam was
                indulging. Whether she was<br>
                indulging there in the white powder, I really
                don&#146;t know, but obviously here in America
                she died of a heroin overdose. I don&#146;t know.<br>
                If Jim did take any heroin, I imagine he snorted
                some heroin and since it was extra pure, and
                perhaps extra strong, I really don&#146;t<br>
                know if that - I really don&#146;t know anything
                about heroin, but I have heard there was a rash
                of overdoses. Junkies were dying in Paris.<br>
                A very strong shipment of &#145;China White&#146;
                had come in. Now I can perceive of perhaps &#133;
                I can construct a story of Jim snorting<br>
                some lines of heroin white, and the way Jim did
                things &#133; (<i>Ray lightheartedly chuckles</i>)
                &#133; I shouldn&#146;t laugh, but the way Jim
                would<br>
                do things, he would always do more than he should
                of anything. That&#146;s what he did. &#147;<i>Well
                let&#146;s just see what this stuff does!</i>&#148;<br>
                Boom! I can just see a couple of lines being laid
                out and &#147;<i>I&#146;ve heard about this!</i>&#148;
                Bam bam! And he did probably &#133; who knows<br>
                and had it been - if this is what happened, he
                snorted some extra strong, extra pure heroin and
                a huge amount. He probably started<br>
                feeling sick, had been drinking and decided to
                take a bath, to lie down in a bathtub and maybe
                he was breaking out in a sweat.<br>
                Sweating hot or cold or whatever happens. So if
                this is the situation, a bath is a relaxant,
                alcohol is a relaxant, heroin is a relaxant.<br>
                So if you add one on top of another and another,
                and you know what? It&#146;s very possible that
                the autopsy said that Jim&#146;s heart had<br>
                stopped. He just stopped breathing in Paris and
                died. (<i>Spoken very quietly. Almost a whisper.</i>)
                And if he did, it was probably the<br>
                sweetest death anyone has ever had in a very,
                very long time and he deserved a sweet death.</font></td>
