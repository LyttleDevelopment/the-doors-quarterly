                and I told the driver Hervé's address. Soon we
                arrived at the Pont de la Concorde, which is a
                bridge crossing the Seine, and Jim wanted the
                taxi to stop. He got out and went away from the
                taxi. I paid the driver and he drove away. Jim
                wanted to jump up the railing. I saw two cops
                coming and said, </b><b><i>&quot;Be careful, cops
                are coming!&quot;</i></b><b>. But Jim shouted, </b><b><i>&quot;Fuck
                the pigs!&quot;</i></b><b>, something like that,
                and he went quiet again. And I stopped another
                cab which took us to the house where Hervé
                lived. Again I paid the driver and he asked for
                some tip, but had just this big banknote left.
                Jim asked, </b><b><i>&quot;What does he
                want?&quot;</i></b><b>, and I told him, </b><b><i>&quot;He
                wants some more money.&quot;</i></b><b>. So Jim
                took out of his pocket like 5.000 French Francs,
                which was a lot of money at that time, and gave
                it to the taxidriver. The driver stared at this
                whole bunch of banknotes and gave them back to me
                thinking we were crazy. I passed the money back
                to Jim and we went up to Hervé 's flat. On each
                floor Jim knocked on my back and hissed </b><b><i>&quot;Sssssh,
                they are sleeping!&quot;</i></b><b>. I rang
                Hervé's door and Yvonne opened. I remember there
                was this Belgian girl staying overnight in the
                same apartment, and she thought we were the
                police wanting to search the flat. So she threw
                all her hash out of the window in a hurry! We got
                in, and Hervé got up and asked, </b><b><i>&quot;What
                are you doing here in the middle of the night,
                it's four o'clock!&quot;</i></b><b> And I
                answered, </b><b><i>&quot;I'm here with Jim
                Morrison!&quot;</i></b><b> </b><b><i>&quot;Fuck
                you, Gilles&quot;</i></b><b>, Hervé responded. </b><b><i>&quot;You
                just want to sleep in my apartment. Take a
                sleeping-bag and sleep!&quot;</i></b><b> But Jim
                just entered the room, crashed upon their bed and
                fell asleep. Hervé and Yvonne had to take their
                sleeping bags, because it was impossible to move
                him, he was lying across the bed and stayed there
