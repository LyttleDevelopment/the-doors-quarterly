        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>During my first
        visit to Los Angeles it was rather difficult to get an
        interview date with Robby Krieger. Robby and his band
        were working on two albums simultaneously in the studio,
        and he was also busy doing the final mixing of already
        finished tracks in another studio.</b> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Eventually,
        however, we were able to agree a date one afternoon, when
        a studio appointment for the band was cancelled.</b> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Robby Krieger
        lives in the Benedict Canyon, through which runs a small
        winding asphalt road. On one of the numerous hills which
        line the road on both sides and hiding the houses behind
        from view, a narrow dusty alley leads to a large green
        gate, which vividly reminded me of Elvis's gate at
        Graceland. Linda Kyriazi, Robby's PR manageress, who
        drove me to this interview in her car, did not need to
        ring the bell, and the gate opened with a quiet squeak.
        Our arrival had obviously been watched.</b> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>The car stopped next to a few
        American veteran cars parked underneath shady magnolia
        trees adjacent to a two-storey house. Robby emerged from
        the front door with a friendly &quot;Hello, how are
        you?&quot;. He was wearing one of those kitschy, but
        comfortable Hawaiian shirts, corduroy trousers and no
        shoes. His hair had got thinner and more reddish, than I
        had remembered from my earlier meeting with The Doors.</b>
        </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>He invited us into his
        comfortably cool, air-conditioned house and told us to
        make ourselves at home. This was, however, made
        impossible for me by Robby's dog, Teddy, a huge shaggy
        gray monster, who tried to knock me over to the ground,
        despite his master's calling to him not to do this. Only
        after I grabbed a sock that was lying on the floor with
        which I managed to lure Teddy out of the front door, we
        got the desirable coziness - apart from Robby now running
        outside to rescue his precious sock!</b> </font></p>

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>In the meantime I got the
        opportunity to take a look around family Krieger's living
        room (Robby lives here with his wife, Lynn, and his son,
        Waylon). There seemed to be a homely kind of chaos in
        this huge room. Numerous platinum and gold records were
        standing on the floor or hanging on the walls. Above the
        gray fireplace ledge a Nastassja Kinski poster graced the
        wall, which showed her naked apart from a fully grown boa
        constrictor being wrapped around her. Next to this stood
        a quietly sounding television set and a sinfully
        expensive music tower with black speakers built into the
        wall. An enormous wall of shelves was overflowing with
        records, reels, books and cassettes. A very old Dobro
        guitar was leaning in front of the large round window
        with a view onto large oaks and smaller shrubbery.
        Amongst the freshly ironed clothes on the living room
        table was a brown Persian tomcat, who watched me
        suspiciously.</b> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Linda was putting some cans
        of beer into the fridge in the adjoining kitchen,
        remarking that &quot;... Robby always forgets to buy any
        drinks when he gets guests!&quot;, when Robby returned
        and asked me to follow him. He turned towards a glass
        door and hurried up a few stairs to his home studio. Here
        I also find numerous platinum and gold records on the
        walls of a room which is otherwise filled with countless
        musical instruments and other musical equipment.</b> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>My eyes immediately turned to
        a black 1955 Gibson Les Paul with golden metal
        attachments that was leaning against a Fender Twin Reverb
        amplifier. Robby, who had noticed my interest, smiled.
        &quot;This is my original Doors guitar which I always
        used when playing the slide, either at concerts or in the
        studio, during Moonlight Drive', Who Do You Love' or Wild
        Child'. I think you can also see it in the video Dance On
        Fire'.&quot;&quot;And where is the red Gibson SG, which
        is better known to Doors Fans from the photos?&quot;, I
        asked. Robby pulled a face. &quot;Somebody stole that one
        of me towards the end of the Doors era. It is probably
        hanging somewhere on a fan's wall right now. It was my
        favorite guitar which I had right from the beginning.
        Really, this was my very first electric guitar and I had
        used it during the whole time I spent with The
        Doors.&quot; He picked up a red Gibson 335 and plugged
        the other end of the lead into an amplifier. A few more
        little lamps lit up on other electronic equipment, and
        the rich sound of a trombone filled the studio.
        &quot;With these Computers I have millions of
        possibilities of changing a guitar's sound,&quot; he
        said, pushing further buttons. Now the guitar sounded
        like a harp. &quot;So this is Robby's hobby&quot;, I
        added, hinting at the 12&quot; single with the same
        title. He smiled. &quot;Actually, I only record demos and
        try out new sounds in this studio. For records I rather
        prefer real guitar sounds and, of course, a real band. I
        don't like these drum computers.&quot;</b> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Following the push of a
        button, the drum computer just mentioned released a heavy
        rhythm, to which Robby started playing a
        faster-than-the-speed-of light solo. In the meantime, I
        looked at the Doors' first gold single for &quot;Light My
        Fire&quot;, having already been stripped of color by the
        constant light from the sun, which hung from a beam above
        the mess of cables.</b> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>We later returned downstairs
        to the living room, where Teddy was already resting
        underneath the table. Armed with an ice cold beer, Robby
        walked over to the music system and put on one of his
        tapes. &quot;You must listen to this,&quot; he said.
        &quot;A track for the new album.&quot; Deafeningly, a
        funk jazz song penetrates the room. &quot;This thing is
        called Strut A-Various'!&quot; he shouted into my ear.
        &quot;A pun of to strut' and Stradivarius'.&quot; &quot;A
        strange title for a song without any violins in it&quot;,
        I shouted back.</b> </font></p>

        second cassette, playing a curious comedy tune called
        &quot;The Black Beatles&quot;, which he had taped from
        the radio. We had a good giggle over this. Eventually

                afraid not. Actually John was in that band, too.
                Our one and only demo was called
                &quot;Paranoia&quot;. (sings)
                &quot;Paranoo-i-a&quot;. Was kinda like
                &quot;Love&quot;, like the old &quot;Love&quot;
                days, kinda like &quot;Hey Joe&quot; chords.
                That's good, actually. We had this great
                piano-player, a friend of mine named Grant
                Johnson, who lives up north now, and he could
                play jazz at that age, you know, and me and John
                and this other guitarplayer, a friend of mine
                named David Wolfe, who was my guitar teacher, he
                still lives in Los Angeles and plays jazz in a
                band named &quot;Citizen&quot;, we did a
                movie-soundtrack, ah - I forgot the name of it
                unfortunately, for the Psychedelic Rangers. But,
                you know, David and I, we both copied a terrible
                Flamenco record called &quot;Dos Flamencos&quot;,
                it had these two guys playing flamenco together,
                and he taught me how to play the guitar. We were
                locked into a room at our school for three hours
                a day, in order to practice our guitars, you
                know. That's why I always had my guitar with me.
                I also started to read a Mickey Baker book, but
                did not even finish the second page. When I saw a
                terrific Chuck Berry concert at the Santa Monica
                Civic Auditorium, I turned into Rock'n'Roll and
                bought my first electric guitar, a Gibson SG, the
                one that got stolen. Before I just played
                acoustic guitars, and I had a holder for my harp.
                Before The Doors I used to play at coffee-houses
                and I played Bob Dylan-songs. I also played with
                a strange band called &quot;The Back Bay
                Chamberpot Terriers&quot;. When I got interested
                in Indian Sitar music I met John Densmore in a
                Maharishi Meditation seminar, who was already
                playing with The Doors at that time. A few weeks
                later he came over to my house with Jim Morrison
                and we played and sang for a couple of hours.
                That was the kick for me. They needed a guitar
                player and they asked me to join them. I was a
                bit skeptic at the beginning but after a few
                sessions and gigs I knew The Doors would make it.</b></font></td>

                painting all the other monuments and stuff. We
                arranged the bust over there, well, but before
                that bust was there we gave Pamela the duty of
                doing that, gave her a lot of money, but she
                never did anything. Her parents were going to put
                her in the same grave, I don't know if they
                actually did that. Her parents were really
                committed to Jim, you know. Businesswise there's
                still contact. They're very unreasonable. The
                poetry should be published, and they don't do it,
                and the movie, you know, a sort of legal mess.
                Sue us, sue this, sue that. It's so stupid, you
                know, because Jim would never have wanted his
                estate to go to those people.</b></font></td>

                some of it. It wasn't that good. You know it was
                Jim's stuff that he didn't want to put out. Most
                of it was written before he went to Paris. There
                is some stuff that he wrote there, and that's
                pretty good. They should put that out. There is
                some more stuff that's pretty good, but in Jim's
                mind he didn't think it was good enough to use.
                That's why we never used it. So I don't think
                it'll be right to use it right now, you know.
                Anyway, that's a big legal mess, too. The lawyers
                that have possession of it think it's theirs,

                estate owns it, and they haven't done anything

                of the interview Robby acted slightly fidgety,
                because during our interview he had received a
                telephone call, and he still wanted to go to the
                studio to supervise the mixing of a new song. At
                the end he gave me one of his platinum records as
                a thank you for small favors I had done him over
                the past years. As happy as a king about this
                present, Linda and I drove off. Following this
                interview I did not only meet Robby on his
                European tour and did the press for him, but also
                visited him again at his house in Los Angeles a
                few more times. Parts of the conversations that
                we had during these meetings have been woven into
                the above interview. Some things we talked about
                have - of course - come true, others not, but I
                wanted you to read this interview as it happened.</b></font></td>
