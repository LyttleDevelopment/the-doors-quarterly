        Sex Revolts (Harvard University Press, 1995), Reynolds'
        and Press' exciting book which looks at rock rebellion
        from the perspective of gender revolution, characterizes
        THE DOORS' creativity (1965-71) in terms of a
        &quot;phallic delirium&quot; and a quintessential
        &quot;burning virility&quot; while comparing Jim Morrison
        himself to &quot;an eternal nomad&quot;. Oliver Stone's
        cartoon-comic movie THE DOORS (1991), on the other hand,
        depicts Morrison as a sex-crazed, semi-literate jerk. I
        think that both of these portrayals, intentionally or
        not, vulgarized the image of Jim Morrison. To me, he was
        always rather a &quot;fair miller-girl of the song&quot;.
        And I am saying this in the right meaning of the term,
        since, in the Scottish tradition (and Morrison's
        ancestors were Scots), mills were once connected with
        brothels. Jim was the kind of Dionysus who became
        magically &quot;cooked Over&quot; into a maiden in a
        woman's kettle of female transformation. He wore his hair
        down like a witch, a priestess of fertility and prophecy,
        a goddess of the hunt, or a wild beast. In Rock Dreams,
        1973, Morrison had Been depicted as a gay icon in a
        string vest, perching on a stool in a crowded bar and
        surrounded by rent boys, drag queens, and sailors. His
        obsession with feminine symbolism and female
        physiological debilitation (menstruation, birth,
        defloration, etc.) can best be seen in a poem he wrote:</strong></font><font

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing
        to live his life on his own terms by rejecting the
        security which could have easily been afforded him, he
        became eccentric, uncompromising, and
        rebellious(especially, considering the fact that he came
        from a solid, military family - his father was an admiral
        in the navy who had participated in the Gulf of Tonkin
        incident off the coast of Vietnam and who commanded
        squadrons of aircraft carriers in the Pacific while his
        son was riding the youth cult show business). Jim, on the
        other hand, was apparently encompassed by something
        feminine; he was attracted to totemism and the mysteries
        of the moon. His self-imposed suffering, sacrifice, and
        eventual annihilation (brought on by an overdose of
        heroin during his stay in Paris with long-time fiancée,
        Pamela Courson) have ultimately contributed to his
        immortality as one of the greatest rock stars in the
        world. The whole process, however, followed from a
        strictly feminine principle where the infliction of pain,
        drinking of blood, consumption of intoxicants, opium
        poisoning, overconsumption of tobacco and other vegetable
        substances, etc. constituted what, according to a Jungian
        psychoanalyst, Erich Neumann is &quot;a journey over the
        night sea&quot; in pursuit of something both dangerous
        and hard to attain. He was a man captured in a woman's
        soul with a penchant for everything supernatural: a
        shaman, a sibyl, a priestess, a wise woman, a seer.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
        Midsummer's Night 1970, Jim was married to Patricia
        Kennealy, the then- editor of Jazz &amp; Pop magazine, in
        her Gothic East Village apartment in New York. But, as
        Dylan Jones points out in his biography of the star (Jim
        Morrison, Dark Star, Viking Studio Books, 1990),
        &quot;this was no ordinary service; it was a Wicca
        wedding, a ceremony based on 'white' witchcraft&quot;.
        The couple is said to have taken part in the ritual
        handfasting, drawing each other's blood, and mixing a few
        drops of their blood with a consecrated wine, which they
        subsequently drank. Perhaps this was the way in which he
        later described his experiences in another poem:</strong></font><font
        color="#FFFFFF"><strong><br>

        <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong><i>&quot;Bourbon is

        <blockquote>
            <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>From 'Wilderness,
            The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison'</strong></font></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In Keruac's words, (starting out as a self-proclaimed
        beatnik, Morrison had read Keruac since the age of
        thirteen), he would have lived up to a special logo of
        &quot;a masquerader, a fraud, and a crooked pulp magazine
        genius leader of some evil&quot; (Jack Keruac, Book of
        Dreams). However, I still prefer to think that Morrison's
        psyche, just as female psyche, was in far greater degree
        dependent on the productivity of the unconscious - the
        matriarchal consciousness encompassing such areas as
        sensual desire raised to frenzy of enthusiasm, a reeling
        drunkenness, an orgiastic passion, and everything that
        defies natural law and the handicap of sterile
        preconceptions: &quot;Let's just say I was testing the
        bounds of reality&quot; (J. Morrison, L.A., 1969). Down
        to the witch and the herb woman of matriarchal decadence.
        And such was the spirit which chanted in him
        rhythmically: &quot;What have they done to the earth?/
        What have they done to our fair sister?/ Ravaged and
        plundered and ripped her and bit her,/ Stuck her with
        knives in the side of the dawn,/ And tied her with fences
        and dragged her down...&quot;(&quot;When the Music's
        Over&quot;). It is worth mentioning, perhaps, that next
        to the Beat generation writers, French apologists (such
        as Celine), and Russian avant-garde poets (Mayakovsky),
        the adolescent Morrison had been immersing himself in
        every book he could get his hands on about demonology,
        esoteric studies, and occult sciences. Following
        Morrison's death, poet Michael McClure formally
        acknowledged the star's literary accomplishments and
        artistry while a Duke University professor and literary
        critic wrote a book titled Rimbaud and Jim Morrison: The
        Rebel as a Poet.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life
        manifested a universal relationship between seizure,
        rage, passion, spirit, poetry, and oracle. Music, for
        him, was only one of the mediums (anyway, it would always
        be either Manzarek, Krieger, or Densmore who did most of
        the composing while Morrison was writing the lyrics). He
        did not hide from anyone that his real interests lied in
        poetry and film. He methodically sought a transformation
        and an awakening through rituals and stupor, through
        intoxication alternated with sleep: &quot;Why do I drink?
        So that I can write poetry&quot; (From Wilderness: The
        Lost Writings of Jim Morrison). There is a curious kind
        of doom spelled out from his songs, something which
        suggests he knew he would die young (at 27): &quot;Make a
        grave for the unknown soldier/ nestled in your hollow
        shoulder/ The unknown soldier...&quot;(from his third
        album, Waiting for the Sun). At times, he was both
        sarcastic and pessimistic: &quot;Riders on the storm,
        Riders on the storm, Into this house we're born, Into
        this world we're thrown. Like a dog without a bone and
        actor out on loan, Riders on the storm&quot;(from L.A.
        Woman, his last album). He used to hide his vulnerable
        poet's soul behind a mask of arrogance and ignorance. He
        played a tough guy on the outside - everything permitted,
        everything goes. A snake skin covered his body - his
        self-description says: &quot;He was a monster, black,
        dressed in leather&quot; (from Morrison Hotel). But he
        also saw himself as a violated male: &quot;Sore and
        crucified..., I sacrifice my cock on the altar of
        silence...&quot; - (from The American Night). He was
        invaded by something feminine and, therefore, alien, to
        undergo a transformation into a lizard:</strong></font><font

        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morrison,
        who started out as an average UCLA's film student writing
        scripts about lone hitchhikers and death in the desert
        (although some controversial reports have it that he
        would hire others to put his ideas on paper), saw himself
        as living in a fatalistic world. He identified with a
        feminine mana to offset the wind of destiny. How close
        his ecstasy came to madness and his creativity to
        psychosis can only be gathered from the sense of doom
        which spilled out of the lyrics from his songs:
        &quot;Kill your father/ F... your mother...&quot; (From
        The End). A few of his poems from Dry Water suggest that
        he was aware of the ancient Sumerian myth which spoke of
        the male remaining inferior to, and at the mercy of,
        Mother Nature, or the &quot;Terrible Feminine&quot; that
        confronted him as a power and destiny. Biographer Dylan
        Jones remarks that on that night in 1970, Morrison
        fainted during his ritualistic wedding to Patricia
        Kennealy because &quot;he came into the presence of the
        Goddess, one of the ancient forces of nature, and one of
        the deities to whom he prayed...&quot;. Or maybe he
        realized then that one had to be prepared to pay with his
        own life for plucking a single leaf from the laurel tree
        of art.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet
        there was still another side to him, the bitter
        self-mockery, the undignified public brawls, the
        offensive street language, and self-destructive treatment
        of himself as a useless misfit in a decadent society.
        Perhaps he was aware (since many people were giving him
        this impression) that he would never amount to anything
        more than a darling of the poetry world crooning in a
        gentle murmuring manner while adapting most of his sexy
        poses from cheap Playboy nudes: the couches, the
        sheepskin rugs, the wine bottles, and furs. Only through
        premature death could his biggest wish (that of being
        recognized a great poet) be realized. Although he strove
        in his life for a liberation of the individual self, the
        total freeing of the psyche from the mythical world which
        has been imposed by civilization and materialistic
        society (&quot;Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of
        the ages...&quot;(from An American Prayer), for many he
        remained just another depressed postadolescent who
        somehow managed to make out of the very contradictions of
        his protracted youth the essence of his charisma. In
        fact, as an individual with an uncommon depth of conflict
        and uncommon gifts (voice, looks, intelligence, artistic
        talent), and with his uncanny luck, he was in the perfect
        position to offer his tribulations to the crisis of a
        whole generation of the late 1960's. Yet he held an
        almost arrogant belief that what shook him as a youth
        was, to quote Erikson (Identity: Youth in Crisis, 1968):
        &quot;a curse, a fall, an earthquake, a thunderbolt - in
        short a revelation to be shared with his generation and
        with many to come&quot; and that &quot;his one life must
        be made to count in the lives of all&quot; (Ibid.).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must
        have posed himself the philosophical question whether
        Truth is objective and thereby immutable, or whether it
        is only a construct of the society or given culture which
        had been passed down in Europe for two thousand years. He
        was beating against the wall in a desire to free himself
        from the oppressive abstraction of values collected and
        classified throughout the centuries, to &quot;break on
        through&quot; into this fourth dimension, to acquire a
        substance of something extraordinary which was supposed
        to offer universal wisdom. Or maybe he just invented the
        fantasy of the fourth dimension, the other side of the
        wall, accessible through the Doors of perception. His
        awareness of being chosen against his will did not
        prevent him from expressing (often implicitly, in his
        self-referential poetry) a latent wish for universal
        power to be recognized as an artist and a seer, in fact,
        a self-made prophet. The prison of his fame as a rock
        star, nevertheless, greatly detracted from this image.
        His tragedy, therefore, may be understood as
        &quot;searching for something that's already found
        us&quot;(from &quot;An American Prayer&quot;). Drugs gave
        him a vision but deprived him of the ability to translate
        this vision in a constructive way. Therefore, on the one
        hand, there was this frantic search for truth and
        universal wisdom. And on the other hand, the utter
        inability to control one's destiny. Something common to
        the fate of us all, perhaps.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently,
        after having attained a status of artistic immortality,
        he has been compared with the likes of the glamorized
        Arthur Rimbaud (read: a long, gigantic and rational
        derangement of all the senses) and with the Russian
        revolutionary poet and futurist filmmaker, Vladimir
        Mayakovsky (that's right - like the latter, he wanted to
        be understood by great numbers - his poetry was concise,
        telegraphic, parsimonious, popular, and simple). Before
        his self-imposed exile in Paris preceding his death in
        the summer of 1971 in the romantic manner of the
        expatriate American writers of the 1920's and other
        poets' maudits, Jim Morrison gave a gift to America, a
        gift which the society did not specify for him in
        advance. After his arrest at the Dinner Key Auditorium in
        Miami (where The Doors performed in March '69) with
        charges of indecent exposure (inspired by the savage
        performances of Antoine Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty) and
        public drunkenness while on stage, he thought of himself
        as artistically misunderstood by his fellow countrymen.
        Yet, his identity was deeply rooted in this country. His
        premature death at 27 can be seen nowadays as a
        tremendous loss to the American modern poetry, American
        music, American theatre (his rituals and antics on stage
        can be justified here since he was drawing his
        inspiration from the legendary and controversial The
        Living Theatre under whose spell he remained until his
        death), American film (it is as yet little known that his
        short film etude entitled &quot;The Hitchhiker&quot;
        which he managed to direct and produce in the breaks from
        touring with The Doors won awards at the international
        art film festivals in Toronto and Vancouver in 1969), and
        the American culture in general. The truth is he was
        working his way to broader horizons, very much ahead of
        himself and of his time. He was not concerned with the
        tribulations and drama of his individual life because
        such concern, no matter who you are, always chains you
        down to the insipid and mediocre. He wanted to shape
        creativity and the collective consciousness on a grand
        scale (&quot;I have ploughed my seed thru' the heart of
        the nation/ Injected a germ in the psychic blood
        vein&quot; - from Road Days.) Time has told us he
        prevailed.</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong> </strong></font></p>

        of the most powerful lyrics in rock music and some of the
        most beautiful poetry of modern literature have been
        produced by James Douglas Morrison, the leader of the
        &quot;Doors&quot; who had been nurtured on Beat poetry
        and literature since childhood. Considering all of this,
        I decided to translate into my native Polish some of his
        poetry including &quot;The American Prayer&quot; as well
        as some selections from his song lyrics and poems from
        &quot;The American Night&quot;, a collection which
        reflects Morrison's fondness of Kerouac's On the Road and
        Celine's Journey to the End of the Night.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A French
        literature professor from Duke University, Wallace
        Fowlie, notes in his brilliant book Rimbaud and Jim
        Morrison - The Rebel As a Poet: &quot;Compared with the
        poetry of Villon and Rimbaud, Morrison's work appears as
        a reflection of great poetry. But the reflection is
        obsessive and subtle. His place is among those men whose
        numerous departures in life, whose instability and
        restlessness, have immobilized them for us. Gratuitous
        images spring up in Jim's verses like reflexes and
        answers to the subconscious law of chance and free
        association&quot; (Fowlie, p. 123). Morrison's poetic
        imagery, often dominated by violence, death, raw and
        savage eroticism, dreams and magic was also partly
        influenced by other writers such as Balzac, Molière,
        Cocteau, Joyce, Blake, Genet, Huxley, and Nietzsche - all
        of whom he read voraciously. However, his innovative use
        of language was, to a great extent, inspired by the more
        recent works of the Beats: Kerouac, Ginsberg, McClure,
        and Ferlinghetti. His poetry is often layered with
        metaphors and symbols which do not easily reveal their
        meaning upon the first reading. His language is, at the
        same time, elegant and savage.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is
        especially interesting to note how much Morrison as a
        poet had in common with another literary rebel - Vladimir
        Mayakovsky. In &quot;A Cloud in Pants&quot;, Mayakovsky
        is aware of both the destructive and creative elements of
        the city. He speaks of &quot;grease-paint&quot;,
        &quot;flags blowing in the fever of fire&quot;,
        &quot;dying sunsets&quot; like those in Marseilles,
        &quot;the square pushing aside the church porch that was
        stepping on its throat&quot;, &quot;rain covering the
        sidewalks with sobs&quot;, as well as of &quot;the
        teeming streetfolk: students, prostitutes,
        salesmen&quot;. Nevertheless, the city's dynamic way of
        life, its multiplicity of colors, its vitality were, in a
        way, advantageous to an arrogant and caustic poet whose
        &quot;soul does not contain a single gray hair&quot;. He
        also speaks metaphorically of &quot;town towers of Babel
        we raise again in our pride&quot;, of &quot;Golgothas in
        the halls of Petrograd, Moscow, Odessa, and Kiev&quot;,
        of &quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;. His cities are full
        of blood, rebellion, and inquietude in the &quot;foul
        weather of betrayal&quot; suggesting the political
        upheaval brought about by the Russian Revolution. His
        cities are also filled with beggars, pedestrians
        suffering from tuberculosis, soldiers &quot;mutilated in
        war&quot;, &quot;naked whores&quot; hurling themselves
        from &quot;a burning brothel&quot; and madmen. This
        strange succession of monstrosities reflects the social
        disintegration which took place following the Revolution
        of 1917 and which may have inspired the poet to make his
        own private rebellion by not wanting to &quot;make gifts
        to mares of vases cast painstakingly in Sevres&quot;.
        Mayakovsky's revolutionary poem A Cloud in Pants is
        almost synonymous with Morrison's &quot;Peace Frog&quot;
        which is filled with similar images of flowing rivers of
        blood in various American cities.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Women,
        Fire, and Dangerous Things (1987), George Lakoff argues
        that there are two distinct views of human thought and
        language. First assumes that the human mind which makes
        use of internal representation of external reality
        mirrors nature (correct reason mirrors the logic of the
        external world). It maintains that mind is an abstract
        machine manipulating symbols. This is the objectivist
        view. On the other hand, according to experimentalist
        view, thought is embodied in the structures used to put
        together our conceptual systems. These structures grow
        out of bodily experience and make sense in terms of it -
        this is the core of our conceptual system. This core is
        grounded in perception, body movement, and experience of
        a physical and social character. Thought, according to
        experimentalists is imaginative - some concepts are not
        directly grounded in experience (metonymy, metaphor,
        mental imagery). These concepts Go beyond the literary
        mirroring or representation of external reality.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Women,
        Fire, and Dangerous Things (1987), Lakoff shows that an
        emotion, anger, has a conceptual structure and he
        proceeds to investigate various aspects of it. He
        examines some of the conceptual metaphors associated with
        lust and rape and he concludes that lust is often
        associated with hunger while the object of lust is food.
        Morrison's poetry is full of such culture-specific
        metaphors. In many of his poems as well as his song
        lyrics, lust is heat, insanity, a functioning machine
        (especially a car), a game, war, or a reaction to a
        physical force. Lakoff notes that a particularly
        important fact about the collection of metaphors used to
        understand lust in our culture is that their source
        domains overlap considerably with the source domains of
        metaphors for anger. &quot;The domains we use for
        comprehending lust are hunger, animals, heat, insanity,
        machines, games, war, and physical forces&quot; (Lakoff,
        415). Here are some culture-specific examples from
        Morrison's poetry:</strong></font><font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>

        anything perhaps, his poetry is exceptionally cinematic.
        I mean all these images, these &quot;scenes of rape in
        the arroyo&quot;, those &quot;searchlights at dusk&quot;,
        these &quot;sunlit deserts (and) galaxies of dust, cactus
        spines, beads, bleach stones, bottles and rust cars,
        stored for shaping&quot;, &quot;old books in ruined
        temples&quot;, and &quot;stars in a shotgun night&quot;.
        I am sure he was able to pick up some of them in the
        course of your adolescent trans-American travels on the
        road, or while reading Blake, Huxley, Celine, Plutarch,
        the Beat poets as well as many other authors (James T.
        Farrell, maybe), and later, of course, in the
        cinematography department at UCLA. Reading his poems is
        like taking drugs: they lead us into a trance of images,
        walls of sacred visions, inducing altered states of
        consciousness of a profoundly hallucinatory nature which
        all culminate in a unique contemplation of the meaning of
        this world with a new awareness. At 27 he wrote: &quot;I
        have ploughed my seed thru' the heart of the nation.
        Injected a germ in the psychic blood vein.&quot; And
        then, in the same poem, his prophecy with its somewhat
        disquieting sound: &quot;Spectators at the Tomb - riot
        watchers&quot;. Whose tomb? His own? Was he really able
        to predict the delinquent crowds gathering around his

        in one of your longer poems, &quot;Lament&quot; which was
        based on the idea of a wounded, victimized male. In
        &quot;Dance on Fire&quot;, a 1985 documentary videotape
        about The Doors there is one sequence which corresponds
        to what he has written and which I find especially
        unique. It opens with all four of The Doors walking
        together along a rocky beach to the background music of
        &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;. Jim Morrison is playing
        the role of Hyacinthus, a beautiful youth who was slain
        by Apollo, or Orpheus, the victim whose body was
        ultimately torn apart by wild boars, or even, perhaps,
        St. Sebastian - because he is being tied to a pole. A
        shot is fired (or so we only hear) and blood spills out
        from your mouth - right on the white hyacinths, the
        flowers which figure prominently as symbols in the Greek
        myth of Hyacinthus (they are known to have grown from the
        bloodstained grass). And I am sure that, being so well
        versed in classics, he must have deliberately thought it
        over, - he read Plutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks, a
        fact meticulously recorded in the history of rock 'n
        roll. The 'firing squad-Hyacinthus' sequence is perhaps
        the most striking image in the whole 'cinema verite'

        matching that of Rimbaud, from The Lords:
        &quot;Metamorphose. An object is cut off from its name,
        habits, associations. Detached, it becomes only the
        thing, in and of itself. When this disintegration into
        pure existence is at last achieved, the object is free to
        become endlessly anything.&quot;</strong></font><font

        face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>At least two lines from
        his poetry indicate that this particular aspect of
        shamanism has had a profound effect on his consciousness:
        &quot;Insanity's Horse Adorns the Sky&quot; from &quot;I
        Can't See Your Face In My Mind&quot; and &quot;Awkward
        instant/ and the first animal is jettisoned/ legs
        furiously pumping/ the stiff green gallop (...)/ Consent/
        in mute nostril agony...&quot; - from &quot;Horse
        Latitudes&quot;, a poem he wrote while still in high
        school. It was indeed not uncommon for Indo-European
        shamans to sacrifice horses to a god of the sky or
        storms. You were very much into shamanism, you must have
        known that when the Altaian shaman sacrifices a horse, he
        invokes a multitude of spirits and the birds of heaven.
        Then, he beats the drum violently, indicating a
        'mounting' into the sky, accompanied by the spirit of the
        dead horse. After ascending through several heavens in
        visionary consciousness, the shaman converses with the
        creator god Yayutsi and also bows before the Moon and Sun
        in turn. Finally, at the celestial abode of bai Ulgan,
        the shaman learns details of future weather patterns and
        the outcome of the harvest. The shaman then collapses in
        a state of ecstatic release (from Shamanism by Nevil
        Drury, p. 23). For those of you who had no idea what
        &quot;insanity's horse adorns the sky&quot; meant in
        Morrison's lyrics, this aspect of shamanism offers a
        quick explanation, I believe.</strong></font><font

        the influence of Jean Genet's (the 'French Beatnik's')

        However, if one reads Thief's Journal, full of homosexual
        acts and crime, one is at once reminded about the trait
        of his personality - transgressive. And it was Genet,
        too, who wrote in his famous novel:<br>

        is right for men to shun a profound work if it is the cry
        of a man monstrously engulfed within himself... Creating
        is not a frivolous game. The creator has committed
        himself to the fearful adventure of taking upon himself,
        to the very end, the perils risked by his
        creatures...&quot; Sounds like a good preface to Jim's

        ancient, masterly tone of &quot;The American Prayer&quot;
        as well as his frequent references to shamans, angels,
        and omens are all reminiscent of the work of Juliusz
        Slowacki, the great national Polish romantic poet who,
        before his premature death at 39 in 1849, penned
        &quot;Anhelli&quot;. This poetic masterpiece about a
        group of Polish insurgents, sent to exile in the midst of
        the Siberian winter, and of the Shaman, their leader,
        tells of the Northern Empire where the spacious and
        colorful skies reigned supreme over the boundless,
        hallucinogenic, and frozen plains full of angels, ghosts,
        strange heavenly apparitions, as well as ominous signs
        lighted by stars shotgun in the night. It seems unlikely
        that Morrison could have known about Slowacki since the
        latter's major works have not been translated into
        English at that time. But to me, the similarities were
        striking. </strong></font></p>

        face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>Jim's own transformation
        into a shaman on the desolate Venice roof in the summer
        of 1965 after he finished college sounds like a
        flirtation with madness. In the most comprehensive
        biography to date, Riordan and Prochnicky tell us about
        this time: &quot;Jim Morrison knew that a change was
        taking place inside him. After a while he rarely left the
        roof, dropping acid almost continually, and spending his
        time meditating and writing...&quot; There was the lack
        of regular meals, heavy drug use, and utter isolation.
        But Jim did not go insane. Jim's transformation was quite
        successful as it culminated in him changing from a
        slightly overweight kid to a rock legend, a shaman, a
        poet.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet,
        according to Nietzsche, what may be nourishment and
        delectation to the higher type of men may become poison
        for the inferior type. Let us take as an example the case
        of Ross David Burke, a paranoid schizophrenic with manic
        depression who believed he had invented rock music and
        whose journal &quot;The Truth Effect&quot; had recently
        been published under the title: When the Music's Over
        (1996). One of the people in the introduction described
        him as &quot;always making references to or quoting Jim
        Morrison... a lot of really heavy Doors stuff&quot;. He
        would self-medicate with alcohol and marihuana, sit in
        his room for days playing loud rock music, read Huxley's
        The Doors of Perception, write poetry (not bad), or
        compose music and play it out with a band on weekends.
        But at the age of 32 this intelligent,highly sensitive,
        perceptive, talented, and at times even brilliant man,
        who knew how to write as well as play drums, guitar, and
        harmonica, has committed suicide by taking much more than
        a lethal dose of drugs. Reading his book is a journey
        into his mind, into his delusions, hallucinations, and
        fantasies. The people who helped put this book together
        (Dr. Gates and R. Hammond) found themselves listening to
        the Doors and other bands of the 60's and 70's as well as
        reading the poetry of Jim Morrison in order to piece
        together his life story. The moral of the story? It is
        very dangerous to find oneself obsessed with the Jim
        Morrison myth.<br>

        had to know the rules of this unfair world. He repeatedly

        are born to endless night&quot;. Furthermore, he had a
        special predilection for visiting such perverse places as
        the 'Butterfly' in New York (a porno theater)or the Rock
        &amp; Roll Circus in Paris (a heroin dive). He had a
        great interest in human misery, perversion, and
        degeneration. After all, he once wanted to be a
        sociologist or a writer which only makes it seem logical
        that he must have possessed the qualities of an observer.
        Was his own innocence lost in the process? Or is
        innocence as such only a mystification? In one of his
        published interviews, I remember him having been quoted
        that if he had to do it all over again, he would have
        settled for a quiet and unknown artist undemonstratively
        plodding away in his little garden. With the kind of
        intelligence he was endowed with, he must have known the

        repeatedly comes up in his early lyrics suggesting that
        he, too, was quite enthralled by it. And some still argue
        that this is where he is living today. The controversial
        book The End by Bob Seymore questions the validity of the
        French doctors' death certificates and insinuates that
        the whole thing, including the almost secret and
        surprisingly hasty burial in Paris attended by a closed
        circle of the most intimate friends, had only been a part
        of a deliberately prearranged 'exit' or rather an escape
        from the prison and pressures of fame. And the whole
        thing with singer Marianne Faithfull (who used to run
        around with Mick Jagger) and the French count who,
        apparently, have helped Jim out in his secret passage to
        some remote place in Africa... Well, this is definitely
        something to be inspected further. Let's hire a detective

        face="Arial,Helvetica"><strong>One thing a man can teach
        a dependent co-living female without a marriage license
        is how to be a good whore. In ancient Greece, daughters
        of aristocratic households would associate with men for
        intellectual purposes and be treated as their equals.
        They would think it a disgrace to allow themselves to
        engage in sexual relations with these men. (Such services
        were performed by the lower class: both women and men.
        Nowadays, on the other hand, in a ploretarian society, we
        all have come down to this level - we are all -except for
        a handful workers and we are all prostitutes. Aristocracy
        is dead). And so, after Jim's death, when he, in fact,
        had left millions in the records, Pamela was forced to
        sell her fragile beauty by the hour to keep her expensive
        drug habit - all of this due to some legal
        inconsistencies in their alleged 'marriage'. I personally
        prefer Jim's relationship with Patricia Kennealy - his
        real intellectual equal who in her autobiography Strange
        Days righteously encourages us all impressionable fans to
        &quot;get some weight into our lives, read some books,
        think some thoughts&quot; and who basically implores us
        all not to thoughtlessly imitate Jim Morrison but rather
        to seek that very same light for ourselves which had
        guided his creativity and which he so spontaneously
        recognized in his own individual life. </strong></font></p>

        off than his fellow university students, for example. And
        then, in his art and in his lyrics, he has tried to
        expose and fight against the American materialism. This
        was a big break-through in Rock'n'Roll compared to what
        is being advertised by most rock stars today: all they
        project is a desire for money, after the dollar. Their
        message reads: &quot;money equals power and
        control&quot;. And Jim Morrison happened to own a car at

        to watch TV. They had something on the original rock
        bands: 'The Animals', 'Cream', and 'The Doors'. I heard
        &quot;In the White Room&quot; by 'Cream', &quot;When I

        me and I listened to it constantly. It gave me a great
        deal of joy, a great deal of pleasure. I was able to get
        Jim's The Lords &amp; The New Creatures in Warsaw and I
        read it both in English and in translation. Upon my
