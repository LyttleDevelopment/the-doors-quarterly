                ever played together as The Doors was<br>
                &#147;Moonlight Drive&#148;. That first rehearsal
                session when the oors first got together &#145;n
                played &#147;Moonlight Drive&#148;, and Robby put
                on his bottleneck and I showed him the
                chord-change, a simple Blues song, and that was
                the first time The Doors - that Robby came down
                to<br>
                play &#150; and the first time The Doors ever
                played together and, you know, we smoked a joint
                and talked for a while and talked about life.<br>
                Man, God and existence &#150; as The Doors always
                were want to talk about, and then we started to
                play. And by that time we were all<br>
                pretty high, and played the song, and it was just
                absolutely amazing. The power of The Doors
                together locked in, a thing happened and<br>
                it just locked in together and we played that
                song and it just was driving and powerful. And at
                the end of it we all just sorta looked at<br>
                each other &#133; Jesus Christ, wow! And I told
                &#133; that&#146;s when I told John and Robby,
                you know, I played in a lot of bands, and
                I&#146;ve been<br>
                playing the piano since I&#146;ve been 7 years
                old, played with a lot of people. But I&#146;ve
                never played music until this moment. Now I know<br>
                what playing music is all about. Look, we just,
                you know, our conscious minds just went away and
                we&#146;ve just lowered ourselves down<br>
                into that primordial place, that collective
                Jurassic, collective unconscious, that primordial
                place that we all come from, where all the<br>
                power and the danger lies. And every guy was
                willing to go into that dangerous place, that
                place, that secret place, and expose himself<br>
                to the other members of the band through their
                music, to expose himself in his vulnerability and
                weakness. And in all our vulnerability<br>
                came this incredible sense of power. Oddly
                enough, by going there and exposing those
                weaknesses, you gain an incredible power.<br>
                You find that instead of being weak; you find
                yourself to be actually incredibly powerful,
                infinitely powerful.</b></font></td>

                You know, we went into the recording studio with
                Rothchild and Botnick, and there<br>
                was a simple little piece and it was basically
                like a warm-up thing just to see how the studio
                was sounding and everything. And, we also did
                &#147;Moonlight Drive&#148;. We never used that
                version of &#147;Moonlight Drive&#148;, however,
                the sound wasn&#146;t right and we had to play
                with this and so, &#147;Indian Summer&#148; was
                another one just to test the sound in the studio,
                because it was a very simple piece. So it was
                like doing &#147;The End&#148;,<br>
                beause it was an Indian song, but instead of
                doing &#147;The End&#148; to test the studio
                with, &#147;The End was far too long and intense
                to be<br>
                experimenting with just the sound and technical
                things, we did this short little Indian-style
                piece. Also in the studio, interestingly, the
                first<br>
                song we recorded was &#147;Moonlight Drive&#148;.
                o the first song Jim sang to me on the beach when
                we first got together, and he said, &#145;I got

                the first song The<br>
                Doors do is &#147;Moonlight Drive&#148;. When we

                Paul said, Bruce said, &#145;Well, let&#146;s do

                right, right. That was fun. It was a Moog

                played by a guy named Paul Beaver.<br>
                And he came down with that thing and set the
                stuff up and I just could not believe it. What? I
                couldn&#146;t believe it. There&#146;s a keyboard<br>
                playing this &#133; it was a spaceship, it looked
                like a spaceship. He just brought in module after
                module after module, and they were all very<br>
                big modules, and when he had it all set up it was
                like the Star Trek, I thought we were on a
                spaceship, but no, it was the control room.<br>
                I said, &#145;Ok, this is no longer a control
                room, this is now the bridge of the
                Enterprise&#146;, and it was amazing to see him
                twist those knobs. But<br>
                curiously, he could never stop twisting the
                knobs, any time we&#146;d get, he&#146;d get a
                sound that we&#146;d kind of like, he would tweak
                it a little bit<br>
                and it would become another sound, and another
                sound, and, and, and after about an hour of it we
                realized that all we had to do with that<br>
                guy is just as soon as &#133; &#145;Stop!
                Don&#146;t touch a knob!&#146; Because he was in
                &#133; always, always turning and tweaking and
                twisting, and, &#145;How<br>
                about this, well, how about this, how about
                &#133;&#146;, and it went on and on, and they
                were great sounds! We said, &#145;Jesus, will you
                stop already,<br>
                please!&#146; I wouldn&#146;t be surprised I
                that&#146;s what killed him, you know, poor old
                Paul Beaver, and he died quite young. I think he
                was only<br>
                like 42 or 43 when he died. So, probably all that
                twisting of those knobs and those sounds,
                I&#146;m sure his nervous system said,
                &#145;That&#146;s it!&#146;.<br>
                You know the nerve-ends said, &#145;I can&#146;t

                here&#146;s a, here&#146;s a tack piano, but on

                album<br>
                was eight tracks. So when we got into the studio
                and Bruce Botnick showed us this new machine and
                said, &#145;Look, you&#146;ve got eight

                &#147;Love Me Two Times&#148;<br>
                is a harpsichord, tack piano, backwards piano, we
                wrote the music out measure by measure, and I
                wrote just measures and put the chord<br>
                changes in and started on the lower right hand
                side and read the whole thing backwards, and as
                it was playing backwards, hoping, not<br>
                knowing, you know, I could tell when I was in the
                right chord, but not knowing where the hell it
                was all gonna come out, and the song began<br>
                as I ended. I played the last, I said, &#145;God,
                I&#146;m at the beginning here, I hope this is
                the last&#146;, and sure enough. The playback in
                my ears<br>
                stopped, &#145;n I said, &#145;Oh, good!&#146; It
                was one pass, &#145;n I said, &#145;Don&#146;t

                brightness in there?&#146;. Well, it was The

                brightness is because of the nature of the<br>
                human beings that were making the music, you
                know, they were bright, poppy guys. And bright
                poppy guys just infused the tape with<br>
                that energy that comes off &#133; that ame out of
                their psyches. And for The Doors the energy was
                not bright and poppy &#150; it was a<br>
                primordial, primeval power of nature, of birth
                and rebirth, and the energy of the planet.</b></font></td>

                was in L.A. after he had left Yoko, and he was
                here with Harry Nilsson and doing his one year of<br>
                drunkenness or whatever, like the Ray Milland
                movie &#147;The Lost Weekend&#148;. Well, John
                was doing his lost year. And he was driving<br>
                a Porsche Speedster, &#145;cos I remember seeing
                the car &#150; an old Porsche Convertible &#150;
                and at the time we were thinking about getting<br>
                another car &#150; we had a Citro?n DS 21 Pallas,
                a red bathtub, inverted bathtub &#150; and here
                comes this Porsche Speedster, and I said,<br>
                &#145;Oh, what a neat car, man&#146;, and I
                looked at the car and then I looked at the guy
                and I realized the guy was John Lennon. And he<br>
                looked at me in the Citro?n and the license-plate
                was &#147;MAU MAO&#148;, a play on the Chairman
                Mao and the African Mau man, a<br>
                personalized license-plate that you could get in
                California &#133; so I was driving, Dorothy was
                sitting next to me and she was holding<br>
                Pablo who was like a year and a half on her lap
                next to me and Lennon looked at me and his eyes
                then flashed over to a guy &#150; John<br>
                Lennon and I are the same type with the glasses
                and the hair and everything &#150; and then he
                looked at Dorothy, an oriental girl like<br>
                Yoko, and she&#146;s sitting there holding their
                baby. And two weeks later John Lennon went back
                to New York to Yoko. Whether we had<br>
                anything to do with it or not I don&#146;t know,
                but two weeks later he was back in New York.</b></font></td>

                Angeles is concerned, they put a bunch of shields

                was in a great mood, and we came back<br>
