                know, we weren&#146;t into really documenting the<br>
                stuff that much, it was the, you know, the act of
                existence at the moment is the important thing,
                you know, you live your reality in a moment<br>
                to moment existence, and how you live that moment
                to moment existence is a lot more important than
                documenting it, because if you&#146;re<br>
                documenting it you can&#146;t be living it at the
                same time, you can only one or the other. You can
                live it or you can document it. And we
                didn&#146;t<br>
                really have anybody with us taking it down as if
                it was Holy Writ or anything else like that, that
                would have been ridiculous. Fortunately we<br>
                had Paul Ferrara and Babe Hill as a camera crew,
                because we got Jim Morrison on film, we got lots
                and lots of film with Jim Morrison, you<br>
                can see Jim and how he performed, and how The
                Doors performed, and how they interacted with
                each other, so, the Hollywood Bowl and all<br>
                those other things. You can see The Doors. You
                know, if it hadn&#146;t been for our own film
                crew we wouldn&#146;t have anything of that,
                we&#146;d had the<br>
                Smothers Brothers Show, and the Ed Sullivan Show,
                and, you know, and I suppose at some point we
                would have done some major show,<br>
                recording a concert. But instead we have all
                kinds of things, you know, and it &#133;,
                there&#146;s even Jim in New Haven, you know,
                somebody<br>
                fortunately had that 8mm camera. There&#146;s Jim

                The Doors&#146; album covers<br>
                were usually done &#145;in-house&#146;, too, so,
                you know, they didn&#146;t bring in great graphic
                artists to do the work, they prided themselves on
                doing the<br>
                work themselves, because they had an art
                department. So you&#146;d have to go through the
                rigmarole of their art department, and that was
                always<br>
                a bit of a sticky problem for us. For instance,
                the inside of &#145;Waiting For The Sun&#146;,
                that has that lizard on it.</strong></font></td>

                Vince was great, he&#146;d get very emotional<br>

                He was a very emotional person, otherwise he was

                New-England-American, very serious and down to
                earth, but<br>
                boy, when something struck him the right way he
                was a very passionate guy. And &#145;Riders On
                The Storm&#146; was just brilliant that night.
                And then<br>
                the next or two nights later, whatever it was,
                was New Orleans, and I really don&#146;t remember
                anything about New Orleans except thinking that<br>
                Jim had left the stage, and thinking it was in
                the middle of a song, and in &#145;Light My
                Fire&#146; Jim would sometimes leave the stage,
                sit down, have<br>
                a beer, he&#146;s got, you know, my solo and
                Robby&#146;s solo, so Jim had plenty of time to
                take a break and relax, and a lot of times he
                would pick up<br>
                a maraca and play, leave the microphone, you knew
                he was going to do that, but in this particular
                &#150; I forget which song it was &#150; Jim had
                left the<br>
                stage, had left. The microphone was no longer
                there, and I had my head down. When I play I keep
                my head down and just play the music, and<br>
                Jim is to the front of the stage to my right,
                Robby is directly across from me and John is to
                my left. And Jim, as I had my head down listening
                to<br>
                everything and playing, and Jim was gone! And I
                looked up &#133; and he was standing at the
                microphone. He had not left the stage. And at
                that<br>
                point I knew that something tragic, something
                serious had happened. I had never felt Jim&#146;s
                energy disappear like that before. And, ah, that

                John, Robby<br>
                and I would get together at the office, you know,
                two or three times a week, and just work out
                &#133; start working on some songs and assuming<br>
                that Jim would return somewhere within the next
                &#133; I suppose everyone felt within the next
                six months, you know. Certainly he&#146;d stay
                longer<br>
                than three months. When he left for Paris he
                said, &#147;I don&#146;t know how long I&#146;ll
                stay.&#148; We all said, &#147;Well, how long are
                you&#146;re gonna go over<br>
                there?&#148; &#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148;
                &#147;Well, stay, relax, take it easy, you know.
                Six months, a year, whatever, just relax, take it
                easy, go, enjoy yourself.<br>
                Write, compile your notes.&#148; He had all those
                notes from Miami, and he was going to write the
                book &#145;Observations On America While On<br>
                Trial For Obscenity In Miami&#146;. And that
                would have been great. That was like the French
                guy Alexis De Tocqueville who came to America<br>
                and wrote &#145;Democracy In America&#146; &#133;
                I was really looking forward to Jim, ah, to
                Jim&#146;s comments on what it meant to be an
                American, you<br>
                know, &#145;cause he was so wonderful with the
                way he could write about America, he had such
                insight, so &#133; that he was going to be
                working on<br>
                that, and, you know, just hopefully getting away
                from everything, getting away from, you know,
                from Rock &#146;n&#146; Roll, from the pressures
                of<br>
                stardom, from all his drinking buddies, all those
                guys he would go out and get just too drunk with,
                Tom Baker, etc. ,etc. And so we assumed<br>
                that he&#146;d be gone probably six months, but
                in the meantime, well, let&#146;s work on some
                songs. And that&#146;s what we were doing; John
                Robby<br>
                and I were just putting songs together.</b></font></td>
