                in<br>
                California we had a big election two or three
                weeks ago, and there was a Proposition 128, it
                was called &#147;Big Green&#148;, and it was an
                environmental,<br>
                ecological proposition that was going to just
                stop the polluters, stop the cutting of the
                forests, stop the pollution of the rivers, stop
                poisons of sprays<br>
                and artificial chemicals and pesticides being put
                on the ground &#150; it lost! 2 to 1, it lost 66%
                to 33%! Overwhelmingly, that&#146;s a huge
                defeat. It was<br>
                defeated. And all it had to do with was cleaning
                up our environment here in California. We in
                California said, &#145;No, we don&#146;t want
                this. We do &#133; we<br>
                will vote against this.&#146; So, there is this
                madness up loose upon the land, and perhaps upon
                the globe in which, we&#146;re coming to the
                millennium, too,<br>
                you know, it&#146;s the end of the year 2000. A
                thousand years ago they thought the Apocalypse
                was coming. 990 in that era, in that &#133; 1000

                coming was going to happen, it was imminent. And
                people were just going crazy, because it was<br>
                going to be the end of the world. Well,
                we&#146;re coming right now to the same sort of
                end, except what we&#146;re coming to is the end
                of &#133; the end of the<br>
                organized Christian religion, that&#146;s what
                we&#146;re coming to. The message of Jesus is the
                same message as Jim Morrison, Love! Love! Love is
                the<br>
                answer. What did Jim say? Love is the &#133;
                (sings) love is the answer. Love hides in
                mysterious places, love hides behind the rainbow,
                love hides in<br>
                molecular structures, love is the answer. Jesus,
                Dionysis, here we have to give Dionysis his due,
                the dying and the resurrecting God, Osiris, the<br>
                Egyptians, the ancient Egyptian God, Osiris.
                It&#146;s the same tradition, it &#133; you can
                smash it, you can push it down, but invariably it
                comes back.<br>
                The power of the earth comes back. And what is
                that power? It&#146;s the power of love. And
                that&#146;s what Morrison was all about. Although
                everyone<br>
                would say, &#147;Ray, that&#146;s ridiculous,

                Morrison in his words and in his music.
                That&#146;s the real Jim Morrison. Jim Morrison

                Morrison was, and we agreed on the fact<br>
                that The Doors' music was exceptional and Jim
                Morrison was an exceptional poet. And Danny went

                works for The Doors, and he's been &#133; we've

                but went together to make up a very poetic sort
                of statement. And it was, you know, youthful
                rebellion - a girl standing in ... a girl
                standing in her<br>
                underwear dancing on top of the television set,
                long black garters, actually a German girl, Elke,
                and she's up there, John DeBella's film school<br>
                buddy, John DeBella's girlfriend, and they're
                shooting and she's on top of the TV, dancing on
                the TV the best she can. And Jim said,
                &#147;Quick!<br>
                Turn the TV on, then I'll see what images we
                get!&#148; He turns the TV on and it was &#133;
                what comes on the TV? Leni Riefenstahl's 'Triumph
                of the<br>
                Will'. Can you believe it? What? Pure
                serendipity, pure chance, just boom! It came on
                the TV set. (laughs) So there is this beautiful
                German girl<br>
                dancing in her underwear, long black stockings,
                bra and panties, that's one image. Another image
                is throwing darts at an upside-down Playboy<br>
                Bunny, and with the light coming from the sides
                so as each dart hits the shadow went off to the
                side and you couldn't tell which dimension you
                were<br>
                in, and then there was a bunch of guys getting
                high, and the final image is of Jim with a huge
                joint, just taking a hit of a big joint and
                rolling his eyes,<br>
                and then I think there was another shot of an
                explosion. And there were a lot of other things ,
                too, with a very strange soundtrack, a sort of
                industrial<br>
                kind of soundtrack, and I can't remember what
                exactly was in the soundtrack. Anyway, that was
                Jim's movie, it was poetry, it was a poetic, a
                poetic<br>
                movie. It had nothing to do linear cinema,
                story-telling cinema, characters acting, it was
                just &#133; it was poetry. And the teachers hated
                it, of course.<br>
                (laughs) It was good, it was really quite good, I
                liked it, a lot of people liked it, but the
                teachers hated this piece. &#147;That's not the
                kind of films we're<br>
                making here, Mr Morrison.&#148; But it was Jim,

                The solar boat is the boat &#133;, from 'The<br>
                Golden Scarab' it is the boat that the pharaohs
                and everyone, everyone else rides on through
                infinity, through eternity, and 'the blue bus'
                was<br>
                for me a vehicle that would take you on a
                journey, on a voyage into magical places. That's
                what I always thought of as 'the blue bus'. Blue,<br>
                the color blue, the heavenly blue, the morning
                glory, so the blue of the sky, and you're riding
                instead of riding a stage coach you're riding a<br>
                barque, barque of the pharaoh. Well, what do we
                have in contemporary society? The bus. We all,
                your friends get on board the bus, and we<br>
                start to drive, and eventually we elevate and the
                bus takes off into the cosmos.</b></strong></font></td>
