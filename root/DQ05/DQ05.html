        issue in my collection, but could not find a copy &#150;

        the editor of this magazine! Thanks to Thomas Bollinger
        from Switzerland for scanning<br>
        his copy of THE DOORS QUARTERLY MAGAZINE #5 for this
        site!!!<br>

        So, even the content was (almost) new to me, including
        some &#147;Did you know &#133;&#147; stuff<br>
        that might be of interest to some still, articles on
        books and a report on December 8, 1984<br>
        written by a Swiss fan, a report on a real club meeting,
        and much more &#133;.<br>
        <br>
        But the main topic of this DQ #5 was to give fans info on
        what I had concerning<br>
        the Isle of Wight Festival: newspaper clippings, a report
        written by Margaret Cook who<br>
        was lucky to see the Doors perform live there, the vinyl
        bootleg FIRST FLASH OF EDEN<br>
        that had the near to complete concert on one disc, plus
        John Tobler&#146;s interview with Jim<br>
        at the IoW, once published in ZigZag magazine. On the
        back of this issue you will find a<br>
        reprint of an ad announcing the festival.<br>

        Please do not complain about the low quality &#150; this
        issue came out as a Xerox copy only<br>
        ... with only a few subscribers it wasn't possible to
        have it properly printed at all ...<br>

        And do not forget: This was early 1985! &#133;. letters
        took a long time to be sent, foreign<br>
        magazines weren't available in my country, no internet
        nor email, no mobile phones<br>
        at all &#133;. it was the best I could do at that time
        &#133;.<br>

        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine #5 hasn't been altered<br>
        in any way. You get it as it was published in early 1985,
        as a Xerox copy. Be aware that<br>
        all addresses (private, phone, email and web) are no
        longer valid. Books, LPs or posters<br>
        and further stuff might not be available any longer.
        Please do not respond to any of<br>
        the letters or blame anyone for incorrect details - all
        writers just did the best they could<br>
        back in 1984/'85.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy and let us know what you think ... we will continue
        soon by publishing a digital<br>
        version of another DQ. CU and enjoy!<br>
