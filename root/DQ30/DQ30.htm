        face="Calibri">The December 8 Paris celebrations in 1993
        were just over when I started work on The Doors<br>
        Quarterly # 30, which came out about 4 months later
        &#150; on April 30, 1994 and NOT 1993,<br>
        as the official release date on page 3 says &#133;. can
        you imagine that Kevin discovered that typo<br>
        almost 21 years later while doing the digital work on
        this issue?!<br>
        <br>
        Gosh, I wish those good times could return, everything
        was splendid and delightful &#150; all three<br>
        Doors still on tours throughout the world, all those new
        books, TV features and discs coming<br>
        out! A collector&#146;s heaven had started shortly before
        Jim&#146;s 50<sup>th</sup> birthday anniversary, well<br>
        documented in this issue on 16 (!) pages of &#147;Notes
        from the Underground&#148;, &#147;Official Releases&#148;<br>
        and &#147;Book Reviews&#148;. As they are still very
        active around the world &#150; I am talking about<br>
        coverbands &#150; two very contrary articles on Doors
        coverbands; one of them written exclusively<br>
        for the DQ by Patricia Kennealy-Morrison. I still like
        the great article written on Jim &amp; Jimi at<br>
        the Scene Club, March 13, 1968 (pity, written and
        published in German language only; anybody<br>
        got time to do a translation?); and I still wonder how
        much I like my own article, better to say<br>
        diary, of the events in Paris on Jim&#146;s anniversary.
        This article puts some things right, that were<br>
        published years later by a certain Jochen about the very
        same event in Paris &#133; and if you plan<br>
        to pay a visit to Los Angeles and walk in Jim
        Morrison&#146;s footsteps, you might find part 6 of my<br>
        &#147;L.A. Tours&#148; helpful. See if you can still find
        the former location of the &#147;Roadhouse Blues<br>
        bungalow&#148; or the Doors&#146; billboard, or &#133;,
        or &#133;, or &#133;<br>
        <br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all </font></p>

        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 30 hasn't been altered<br>
        in any way. You get it as it was published on April 30,
        1994 (!). Be aware that all addresses<br>
        (private, phone, email and web) are no longer valid.
