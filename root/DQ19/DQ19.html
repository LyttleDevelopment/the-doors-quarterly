        1988. Such a long time ago, almost 30 years; I still
        can't believe how quickly time passes and memories fade.<br>
        In case you might feel the same, pick up Quarterly #19
        (published in the fall of 1988) and re-read it. Some real
        classics had<br>
        just been released: Jim's &quot;Wilderness&quot; poetry
        book (check my -far too short- review), Tobler/Doe's
        &quot;The Doors in Their<br>
        Own Words&quot;, &quot;The Doors in Europe&quot; was due
        out soon on VCR Cassette, and a few CDs appeared for
        bootleg fanatics; at<br>
        that time mostly copied from used vinyl copies (sometimes
        you could even hear the vinyl crackling in the
        background).<br>
        <br>
        DQ 19 came with the usual mix of news, magazine excerpts
        and reviews. For the first time someone (from
        &quot;Datebook&quot;,<br>
        March 1968) analyzed Jim's signature - to an astonishing
        conclusion. Have a look at my 'Paris Guide Part One', and
        enjoy<br>
        some ancient photos of a club meeting in 1988.<br>
        <br>
        The article 'Bootlegging The Doors' might show you that
        in 1988 there was nothing special available at all,
        although the<br>
        discs mentioned in the reviews became true rarities later
        on. I really like Don Paulsen's interview with The Doors,
        first<br>
        published in &quot;Hit Parader&quot; in 1967. Scott
        Hyder's 'Symbolic Study - Passages of a Poet and Puer'
        was written for the<br>
        C.G. Jung Institute and still makes for an interesting
        read. 'An Afternoon with Jim Morrison', written by Judith
        Simm in<br>
        June 1968 for &quot;Teenset Magazine&quot;, gives us a
        rather personal look on Jim. Most of this interview was
        conducted at<br>
        Olivia's Place, 2615 Main Street, Jim's favourite soul
        kitchen on Venice Beach, while Jim was eating chicken<br>
        liver with onions.<br>
        <br>
        Check John Densmore's insightful phone interview with
        Billy Pinnell (Part 3 - just in case you had missed Part
        4 in DQ 20)<br>
        and then my review of the worst vinyl bootleg ever
        published. Short but interesting is a story of Jim in
        Frankfurt, sent to<br>
        be published in DQ 19 on page 38 by Doors fan Oliver
        Lüth. Last but not least the first part of my interview
        with Robby<br>
        Krieger. Check the DQ website for a complete read here:<br>

        DQ 19 concluded with a small 1967 print advertising six
        days of The Byrds (cancelled) and The Doors at the Whisky
        A<br>
        Go Go. Wish we could have all been there!<br>
        <br>
        For producing this magazine there weren't any computers
        around - everything got typed on my ancient electric
        typewriter,<br>
        and the bigger letters for headings used to be rub-off
        letters on small plastic sheets or plastic lettering
        tapes.<br>
        No free poster but the issue came along with another
        golden bumper sticker.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version
        of DQ 18.<br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        <br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        <br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget: Please note that your digital copy of
        The Doors Quarterly Magazine 19 hasn't been altered in
        any way. You<br>
        get it as it was published in the fall of 1988 (!). Be
        aware that all addresses (private, phone) are certainly
        no longer valid.<br>
        Books, vinyl records, CDs and other stuff might not be
        available anymore. Please do not respond to any of the
        small ads or<br>
        blame anyone for incorrect details - all writers just did
        their best they could back in 1988. And all this happened
        without any<br>
        computers, any emails and of course without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 19 I must tell you
        that there are<br>
        no copies left at all!<br>
        <br>
        Thank you!<br>
