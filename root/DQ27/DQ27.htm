        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #27
        went to the post office on November 1, 1992 and<br>
        see what news we had! Hopkins&#146; Lizard King book came
        out, also Judy Huddleston&#146;s<br>
        Living &amp; Dying with Jim Morrison, Patricia
        Kennealy-Morrison&#146;s Strange Days, James<br>
        Riordan&#146;s The Life and Death of Jim Morrison, Ray
        Manzarek&#146;s Golden Scarab on CD,<br>
        The Doors First Album out on 24-Kt. CD, the famous King
        Magazine had just been<br>
        published in Italy, busy times. But just two new bootleg
        CDs had arrived ...<br>
        <br>
        But DQ27 is a pretty charming issue, I guess. It features
        Albert Goldman&#146;s rare Rock<br>
        Theatre&#146;s Breech Birth article, a San Francisco
        guide for Doors fans, an article on<br>
        Robby Krieger along with one written by fan club members
        about watching the tribute<br>
        band called The Soft Parade. Most interesting of all is a
        memoir on the book No One<br>
        Here Gets Out Alive and how it finally got published
        &#133; strangest one of all: Making<br>
        Contact with Jim Morrison, a &#147;conversation&#148;
        with a spirit, who identifies himself as<br>
        Jim Morrison ...<br>
        <br>
        Inside DQ27 our fans found a big and gorgeous free poster
        of Jim from their<br>
        Frankfurt 1968 concert in fantastic quality.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital issue and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by<br>
        publishing a digital version of Doors Quarterly #26.<br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        <br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>

        And don&#146;t forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine #27 hasn't been<br>
        altered in any way. You get it as it was published on
        November 1, 1992 (!). Be aware<br>
        that all addresses (private, phone, email and web) are no
        longer valid. Books, CDs or<br>
        posters and other stuff might not be available anymore.
        Please do not respond to any<br>
        of the small ads or blame anyone for incorrect details -
        all writers just did the best<br>
        they could back in 1992.<br>
        <br>
