        size="3" face="Calibri">Even further back into the past
        with The Doors Quarterly Magazine #12, which got
        published in the Fall of 1986 ... about 36 years ago ...
        It is<br>
        pretty tough to remember exactly what was going on at
        that time, but checking this issue and the &quot;Talk
        about the Doors&quot; section of The<br>
        Doors Quarterly Magazine always makes things a bit
        easier.<br>
        <br>
        This was the first DQ to include a free black/white
        poster showing 4 rare Morrison in concert photos taken by
        George Shuba on August 3,<br>
        1968 at the Public Auditorium in Cleveland, Ohio. This
        issue also contained a small booklet with German
        translations of a few French<br>
        articles published in DQ 10 and DQ 11.<br>
        <br>
        Did you know that concert promoter Bill Graham was
        initially chosen to produce the upcoming &quot;The
        Doors&quot; movie?! The working title then<br>
        was &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; and nobody knew
        anything about the actors yet.<br>
        <br>
        My first attempt to analyse the video clip of &quot;The
        Unknown Soldier&quot; (in German) and an interesting
        article on Ray Manzarek's new album<br>
        &quot;The Whole Thing Started with Rock &amp; Roll Now
        It's Out of Control&quot; (from Rolling Stone, April
        1975) follow. Also included is a fine piece<br>
        written by David Prockter, for Dark Star Magazine, on
        Ray's solo albums. Michael Horowitz wrote a truly great
        report on Jim Morrison's<br>
        photo session for Vogue Magazine (I wish all photos of
        that session would be published one day). His report
        continues with a few unique<br>
        remarks by photographer Gloria Stavers and ends with an
        insightful view on Jim's former school in Alexandria -
        George Washington<br>
        High School.<br>
        <br>
        My &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot; describe a fine
        bootleg record, &quot;Singing the Blues Vol. 2&quot;,
        which (at that time) contained<br>
        never-before-published tracks from The Matrix club in San
        Francisco in March 1967. Not all songs on this album are
        Matrix tunes.<br>
        &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; is from Monterey, December 1967,
        &quot;Money&quot; is from Danbury, October 1967, and
        &quot;Good Rockin'&quot; is from Bremen,<br>
        Germany, May 1972. The pressing I had at that time was on
        yellow vinyl.<br>
        <br>
        Ellen Sanders wrote first-hand information on the chaos
        at The Doors' Singer Bowl concert (August 2, 1968) from
        her backstage point<br>
        of view - I have no idea where her article &quot;The
        Kingdom has crumbled&quot; stems from. The printing
        quality of the article is really bad,<br>
        sorry about that. The xerox machines in those days were
        still pretty bad. If anyone out there has a better copy,
        please mail<br>
        us a scan - we'd love to add it to this online digital
        DQ. Thank you.<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ 12 there was no computer around -
        everything got typed on my ancient electric typewriter
        and the bigger<br>
        letters for headings used to be rub-off letters on small
        plastic sheets or plastic lettering tapes.<br>
        The entire DQ 12 just got xeroxed ...<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version
        of DQ 11.<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 12 hasn't been altered in any way.<br>
        You get it as it was published in late 1986 (!). Be aware
        that all addresses (private, phone including my own
        address in this issue on page 2)<br>
        are certainly no longer valid anymore. Books, vinyl
        records, CDs and other stuff might not be available
        anymore.<br>
        Please do not respond to any of the small ads or blame
        anyone for incorrect details or typos - all writers just
        did the best they could do back<br>
        at the beginning of Spring in 1987. And all this happened
        without any computers, without any emails and of course
        without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 12 I have to tell
        you that<br>
        unfortunately there are absolutely no copies left at all!<br>
        <br>
        Thank you!<br>
