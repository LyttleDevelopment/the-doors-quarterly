        Quarterly #20 was published late May 1989, right before
        the hot Summer of that year, and it was our very<br>
        first color issue ... well, the first two and the last
        two pages were in color. And I got very positive
        responses about<br>
        that (yes, I kept a huge collection of all fan letters to
        the DQ for many years, but most of them got damaged by<br>
        water in 2009 and had to be thrown away, sadly. A big
        loss of memories, I tell ya!<br>
        <br>
        Among the news you'll find a note on a video (!) of the
        Doors rehearsing songs for 'L.A. Woman' including Jim<br>
        shouting, &quot;Bill bring some more beer&quot; during
        'The Changeling'. What has come of that? Nothing. Just a
        rumor?<br>
        I don't think so. I learnt that from a female fan who was
        very close to the three remaining Doors and Danny<br>
        Sugerman, so there might be some truth in it.<br>
        <br>
        The DQ was the prime source for learning about
        forthcoming new publications such as videos and albums.
        And in<br>
        this particular issue you will find some info about The
        Doors watching a screening of Donn Alan Pennebaker's film<br>
        of their appearance at the Isle Of Wight Festival 1970.
        In December 2016 I heard that one of the new DVD releases<br>
        of The Doors will be their complete Isle Of Wight concert
        - great news, eh? What about their performance at 1969's<br>
        Toronto Popfestival, which got also filmed by Pennebaker
        - or not, as many people say?<br>
        <br>
        After the usual 'Notes from the Underground', find my
        report about Robby Krieger's tour with all those other
        great<br>
        guitarists. How nice it was to see him again and to
        accompany him on this tour, doing the press duties for
        him!<br>
        I had never imagined to meet some of my idols in person
        on this tour - Pete Haycock of the Climax Blues Band,<br>
        Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music, Leslie West of Mountain,
        Jan Akkerman of Focus, and the unfriendly Randy<br>
        California of Spirit. Great memories for me, please check
        pages 8-14 to find the story.<br>
        <br>
        On it goes with a rare article originally published in
        'Cheetah', May 1968, which is a very interesting report
        on<br>
        The Doors' New Haven concert and Jim's arrest.<br>
        <br>
        Frank Lisciandro wrote an article exclusively for this
        DQ, called 'A Few Words About Wilderness' in which he<br>
        corrects some of my previous statements and answers
        questions published in DQ #19. Also featured is part 4 of<br>
        a phone interview John Densmore did with journalist Billy
        Pinnell in August 1985. This interview became really<br>
        famous after it got printed in 4 different DQs and it is
        now mentioned in many a book about the Doors - you will<br>
        soon come to know why. Another interesting interview is
        to be found on pages 34-37, part 2 of one I did with<br>
        Robby in June 1988.<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ there was no computer around -
        everything got typed on my ancient electric typewriter
        and<br>
        the bigger letters for headings used to be rub-off
        letters on small plastic sheets or plastic lettering
        tapes.<br>
        There was no free poster added but it came along with a
        fine new free golden bumper sticker.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version<br>
        of DQ #19.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And don't forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 20 hasn't been altered in any way. You get<br>
        it as it was published in May of 1989 (!). Be aware that
        all addresses (private, phone) are certainly no longer<br>
        valid. Books, vinyl records, CDs or posters and other
        stuff might not be available anymore. Please do not<br>
        respond to any of the small ads or blame anyone for
        incorrect details - all writers just did their best they<br>
        could back in 1989. And all this happened without any
        computer, any emails and of course without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 20, I must tell you
        that<br>
        there are no copies at all left!<br>
        Thank you!<br>
