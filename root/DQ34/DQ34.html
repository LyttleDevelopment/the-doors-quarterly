        issue of The Doors Quarterly Magazine, #34 which came out
        on<br>
        June 25th, 1996. It not only has a bunch of news (some of
        which hasn't come to fruition<br>
        yet, unfortunately. For example Patricia Kennealy's plans
        to publish Jim's love letters,<br>
        poems and drawings dedicated to her; scheduled to see the
        light of day on July 3rd, 2021.</font><p><font
        color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Read the
        interesting article Patricia had written exclusively for
        this issue,) but also<br>
        my critical remarks on some new releases - discs, both
        official and unofficial,<br>
        as well as a couple of book reviews written by former
        readers of the DQ.<br>
        Also see the third version of my Paris guide and my essay
        &quot;Quiet Days in Paris&quot; including<br>
        a rare photo of Jim's parents at their son's grave, taken
        in March of 1991<br>
        by Michelle Campbell.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Furthermore,
        John Densmore's testimony in the Miami courtroom
        (September 16th, 1970)<br>
        shows that even short answers can be enough to make a
        judge and an attorney happy.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Do you
        want to know a secret? The photographed copy of &quot;The
        New Creatures&quot; once<br>
        belonged to Danny Sugerman, who allowed me to take this
        picture but he didn't want<br>
        me to tell people about himself being the owner of the
        vintage book.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">I
        definitely like the photo on the back cover (The Doors in
        Switzerland, April 30th, 1972)<br>
        and I would love to own that super rare poster pictured
        on the front cover<br>
        ofthis DQ- pity I don't.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">The
        magazine came with a free poster, a superb photo of Jim
        in Paris, taken<br>
        by Gilles Yepremian.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3" face="Calibri">Please
