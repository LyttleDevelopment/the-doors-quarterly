        with The Doors Quarterly Magazine #14, which got
        published on June 26, 1987 ... about 33 years ago.<br>
        I haven't had a look at this one for ages, so let's check
        issue #14 of The Doors Quarterly Magazine right here and
        right now.<br>
        Anyway, it was the last DQ that got xeroxed only.<br>
        <br>
        I must admit, in June 1987 I was more or less listening
        to The Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; only (as I was in
        2017 with the fine &quot;Sgt. Pepper<br>
        50th Anniversary Box&quot;). That's why I decided to put
        a big 'It was 20 years ago today' at the top of the cover
        page, along with a Xerox<br>
        of the &quot;Light My Fire&quot; Hit-Ton single label,
        the way the song got first released in Germany.<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ 14 I had no computer or Internet
        (had it even been invented yet at the time?) - everything
        was typed on my old<br>
        and heavy electric typewriter and the bigger letters for
        headings used to be pretty expensive rub-off letters on
        small plastic sheets<br>
        or plastic lettering tapes.<br>
        <br>
        Let's check the content:<br>
        <br>
        In the intro I was writing about an original matrix
        number of a Doors bootleg called &quot;Jim Morrison: The
        Lizard King&quot; (LIZ 1968) ... fearing<br>
        this collectors item might be stolen one day - and it
        was. I (unfortunately) only discovered the loss about 10
        years later and still<br>
        have no idea who might have stolen it. Too bad - just
        this one and only copy of the matrix exists.<br>
        <br>
        Read Danny Sugerman's defending of The Doors' existing
        and forthcoming compilation LPs on page 4; I find his
        letter pretty interesting.<br>
        Has anybody ever made a list of ALL compilation LPs and
        CDs that have been released by the group?<br>
        <br>
        On Page 5 and 6 there's a very personal review of myself
        about how I became a fan of The Doors. Christian Stede
        (deceased in 2015;<br>
        in his obituary his family added a Morrison quote, 'Death
        makes angels of us all ...') added a fine meditation on
        Jim Morrison's<br>
        Intensity; Thomas Collmer adds a review of a reading:
        &quot;An American Prayer&quot; done by Volker Langwagen
        (a German actor).<br>
        <br>
        If only we all had ordered David Sygall's original Jim
        Morrison photo prints for $2 each (check page 12) ...<br>
        in 2020 each of them cost much much more.<br>
        <br>
        Bootlegging The Doors follows and sheds some light on
        different pressings of illegal Doors LPs.<br>
        I still owe a big thanks to our friend Goeran Nystroem
        from Sweden, who published his travel report on Venice
        Beach<br>
        in this DQ; note his annotations of the Big Blue Bus.<br>
        <br>
        The usual fan letters are next, plus my review of the
        disappointing &quot;Hollywood Bowl&quot; EP.<br>
        The Doors talk about some casual stories in part two of a
        1978 interview by Antoine Légat from Belgium.<br>
        <br>
        No poster was added to this DQ but fans found a golden
        bumper sticker in the envelope.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy this digital issue and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version
        of DQ 13.<br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        And dont forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 14 hasn't been altered in any way.<br>
        You get it as it was published in June 1987 (!). Be aware
        that all addresses (private, phone including my own on
        page 2)<br>
        are certainly no longer valid anymore. Books, vinyl
        records, CDs and other stuff might not be available any
        longer.<br>
        Please do not respond to any of the small ads or blame
        anyone for incorrect details or typos - all writers just
        did the best they could<br>
        in the early Summer days of 1987. And all this happened
        without any computer, without any emails and of course
        without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of the Doors Quarterly Magazine 14 I have to tell
        you that<br>
        unfortunately there are no copies left at all!<br>
        <br>
        Thank you!<br>
