        face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #24 was
        published on August 19, 1991, just a few weeks<br>
        after that fatal July 3, 1991. So I was able to write how
        I remembered that day &#150; pure mess<br>
        and chaos. Screaming drunk people had to be chased away
        from the grave by the National<br>
        Guards through the garbage, broken bottles and mud they
        left behind on July 2. On July 3<br>
        it became even worse - after the cemetery officials had
        decided to keep the gates closed.<br>
        You can&#146;t imagine how weird that scene was like.
        Early afternoon about 2000 people (most<br>
        of them drunk as hell) were there trying to get in,
        knocking at the gates using branches<br>
        and bottles, and a huge fire got lit. When they crashed a
        wrecked car into the main gate,<br>
        it broke and the Parisian riot police tried to chase
        everybody off the square - a few &quot;fans&quot;<br>
        got busted, a lot got seriously hurt ... Read the report
        I wrote when I got back from Paris on<br>
        page 5 and 6 of DQ 24; I&#146;ve also tried to analyze
        the big question, &quot;Why did this happen?&quot;.<br>
        I&#146;ve added a few newspaper articles, too.<br>
        <br>
        One of the reasons for the incident was (in my opinion)
        the Oliver Stone movie, and<br>
        Patricia Kennealy-Morrison sent me an exclusive article
        for this DQ setting the record<br>
        straight concerning her part in the movie.<br>
        <br>
        A first attempt at a complete Doors LP discography is
        followed by reviews of new books<br>
        (Densmore, Lisciandro, Seymore and Wincentsen). After
        that you should definitely read<br>
        Patricia Kennealy&#146;s famous Jazz &amp; Pop article,
        'When the Music&#146;s Over &#150; An Audience with<br>
        The Doors'. Also, find Part Two of my L.A. Guide for
        Doors Fans. This takes you around West<br>
        Hollywood and is a follow-up of the guide in DQ 23.<br>
        <br>
        See DQ&#146;s usual Notes from the Underground and a few
        reviews of official releases. Doors<br>
        fan Ko Lankester continues with a nice article on The
        Doors after Morrison, while I myself<br>
        wrote a report on how I searched for Pamela&#146;s grave.<br>
        <br>
        Of course I couldn&#146;t review my own book ('Doors'
        &#150; Heel Verlag) which had recently come<br>
        out in May 1991, so I decided to add just the press
        release written by the publisher.<br>
        <br>
        Don&#146;t forget to read the news from 1991 ... what an
        exciting and dramatic year it was!<br>
        <br>
        There wasn&#146;t any free poster with it but a fine free
        bumper sticker.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by<br>
        publishing a digital version of DQ 23.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        <br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>

        <br>
        And don&#146;t forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 24 hasn't been<br>
        altered in any way. You get it as it was published on
        August 19, 1991 (!). Be aware<br>
        that all addresses (private, phone) are no longer valid.
        Books, CDs or posters and other<br>
        stuff might not be available anymore. Please do not
        respond to any of the small ads or<br>
        blame anyone for incorrect details - all writers just did
        the best they could back in 1991.<br>
        And all this happened without any emails and without the
        internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine<br>
        24 please send an email message &#150; there are a couple
        of copies still available!<br>
        Thank you!<br>
