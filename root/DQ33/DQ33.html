        nice and interesting issue, the one you are getting for
        free in this download?<br>
        Another delayed issue, because I had been busy writing
        THE DOORS ON STAGE<br>
        (very hard to get nowadays, out of print), with Gilles
        Yepremian&#146;s help and some little<br>
        contribution by Fulvio Fiore.</font></p>
        <p align="right"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="3"
        face="Calibri">The front page showed a rather drunk Jim
        Morrison at John Densmore&#146;s birthday party,<br>
        taken December 1, 1969. Robby Krieger had given me this
        photo, which was taken by<br>
        Brendee Greene (wife of Bob Greene, The Doors&#146;
        accountant).<br>
        <br>
        The main story in this issue was how two fans (me &#150;
        who had the idea where to do<br>
        some investigation - and an ex-friend) finally found that
        boy peeping out of the<br>
        window behind Jim Morrison, a famous photo taken by Alain
        Ronay on June 28, 1971,<br>
        in Saint-Leu-d&#146;Esserent near Chantilly in France. I
        am saying &#147;ex-friend&#147;, because this<br>
        here in DQ 33 is the original story, written by myself in
        1995 and it is a true account<br>
        of how that boy was found. Much later, this ex-friend
        published a book in 2004 (!) for<br>
        which he had rewritten the story, leaving off my name
        completely and praising how he<br>
        alone had performed the search for that boy &#133; what a
        rip-off! Judge yourself, dear fans!</font></p>

        face="Calibri">A collector&#146;s nightmare was to write
        about all special official releases from &#147;An
        American<br>
        Prayer&#148;, plus the usual 10 pages of reviews on new
        bootlegs, videos and books.<br>
        A private review of a 1972 Doors Concert in London, a
        good philosophical article by Brent<br>
        Turner and Robby Krieger&#146;s testimony in Miami (dated
        September 16, 1970) still<br>
        make a good read nowadays. Enjoy!</font></p>

        unfortunately I forgot which one...<br>
