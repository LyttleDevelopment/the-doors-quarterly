        face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #22 was
        published on January 20, 1990, more than<br>
        a year before Oliver Stone&#146;s Doors movie would hit
        the cinemas. Working title until<br>
        then was &#147;Riders on the Storm,&#148; and you can
        imagine that John Densmore was not<br>
        amused - he was about to publish his book using the same
        title. They dropped Tom<br>
        Cruise, John Travolta and Dave Brock (singer with the
        tribute band &#147;Wild Child&#148;) for<br>
        the role of Jim Morrison ... at the time of DQ 22, Val
        Kilmer had already been chosen<br>
        and he was busy listening to the Miami tape I sent him (I
        guess he also read the few<br>
        Quarterlies I added to the parcel with his Miami
        cassette).<br>
        <br>
        No wonder (after DQ&#146;s usual page full of news and
        rumors) the main article in DQ 22<br>
        is about the history of The Doors&#146; movie: &#147;Back
        to the Sixties, Darkly,&#148; taken from<br>
        the Los Angeles Times (January 7, 1990).<br>
        <br>
        No CD reviews in this DQ? Bootleg CDs were rare those
        days, so I had to concentrate<br>
        on just one vinyl bootleg, &#147;Someday Soon.&#148; I
        like the following (pretty accurate)<br>
        transcription of &#147;People Are Strange,&#148; followed
        by the preview for a German movie<br>
        (in black &amp; white, 1989) made for TV called &#147;Der
        König der Eidechsen&#148; (the story of two<br>
        Doors fans who decide to take a new bust to Jim&#146;s
        grave after they read the news in DQ<br>
        Magazine that the previous sculpture had been stolen.)<br>
        Part two of a full-length interview by Ko Lankester with
        Patricia Kennealy-Morrison is<br>
        next. I am still amazed - both had never met, but did the
        interview by letters (NO - there<br>
        weren&#146;t any emails at that time!). Next are some fan
        letters and the final part of my big<br>
        Robby Krieger interview (Los Angeles, 1988) plus a
        reprint of Richard Goldstein&#146;s great<br>
        article from New York Magazine, August 5, 1968.<br>
        <br>
        There wasn&#146;t the usual free poster with this issue,
        subscribers got a fine golden<br>
        bumper sticker instead.<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by<br>
        publishing a digital version of DQ21.<br>
        <br>
        CU and have fun!<br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        <br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>

        And don&#146;t forget:<br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 22 hasn't been<br>
        altered in any way. You get it as it was published on
        January 20, 1990 (!). Be aware<br>
        that all addresses (private, phone) are no longer valid.
        Books, CDs or posters and other<br>
        stuff might not be available anymore. Please do not
        respond to any of the small ads or<br>
        blame anyone for incorrect details - all writers just did
        the best they could back in<br>
        1989/&#146;90. And all this happened without any emails
        and without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        Thank you!<br>
