        Another essential CD for your Live-collection. Although
        the Toronto concert has been published before (on CD
        &amp; LP <i>The Beautiful Die Young</i>, Living Legend
        Records LLRCD 037), also on the rare bootleg album <i>Copulations</i>),
        this one here is in much better soundquality, and the <i>Somberness
        Of The Doors</i> (title of the accompanying booklet
        written by some Paolo Ramos) comes through your speakers
        more clearly than ever. An exciting Doors performance.
        One song is missed (<i>The End</i>), but the booklet told
        us about a forthcoming release featuring the rest of the
        concert. That happened in October 1995 with the release
        of <i>All Hail The American Night</i> (Tuff Bites T.B.
        95.1025). The missing song is on that CD. What follows
        after the songs from Toronto is purely fascinating: The
        Doors at the Matrix (2 songs in excellent quality, but
        unfortunately mislabeled as being taped at the Avalon),
        the Winterland and the Family Dog (if the sources are
        correct). 2 tracks from each concert, rather good
        soundquality and - best of all - all of them have never
        been on CD before. The Family Dog tracks have never been
        published on vinyl or CD before. This <i>Moonlight Drive</i>
        Matrix version is bloody interesting, Ray and Jim singing
        a duet; my favourite version of all time. And <i>Back
        Door Man</i> really shows what this song is all about:
        The way Jim performs the song is hot, very hot.
        Interesting enough, this track again proves that Jim was
        the worst harp player of all time (I remember talking to
        Robby about Jim's horrible harp, when Robby looked up to
        me smiling and whispered, &quot;<i>Don't say this when
        Jim is around</i>!&quot;). Anyway, this CD has got a nice
        colourful fold-out cover, fine artwork, an interesting
        article written by a guy who saw the band in Toronto,
        and, even more interesting, some really rare stuff on it.

        A different cover, a different label: A copy of <i>Celebration</i>
        (The Swingin' Pig Records TSP-CD-022). So: nothing new.
        Color photo of Jim's face on the cover, but too bright. <i>Celebration</i>
        had a picture of Jim's grave, please check. Don't pay too
        much for this: this is sold by the bootleggers as a
        mid-price CD! The second release has a different cover
        using the cover shot of Frank Lisciandro's book <i>A

        trademark is their high quality of both recording and
        cover. Their latest CD is this new Doors disc. On it you
        find different rough studio mixes in <b>perfect stereo</b>,
        which had been done for the rare Doors Quadro vinyl album
        <i>The Best Of The Doors</i>. I find it very interesting
        to listen to these, sometimes you have the feeling of
        listening to totally new recordings. But they are
        absolutely the same as on the albums but in different
        mixes. Anyway, have you ever heard <i>Riders On The Storm</i>
        without the whispering and without drums? And <i>People
        Are Strange</i> without drums and guitar solo? Both open
        whole new categories of listening experiences. All songs
        with Morrison are in excellent stereo. You won't believe
        your ears! The second recording is one of the rare 1972
        studio performances. The Doors are having a lot of fun in
        the studio, which makes a great listening. They play
        their standard material of their 1972 tour through
        Western Europe. This concert is presented in good mono;
        studio noises between the songs have unfortunately been
        cut. See the cover - a beautiful rare Morrison photo. In
        general - a CD featuring totally new and unpublished
        material with a superb cover sheet (yes, yes, the
        beautiful rare photo of Jim, all girls will love this!). <b>Recommended</b>!<br>

        This 1995 CD has got a beautiful booklet, indeed! Nice
        colour photos (mostly taken by Frank Lisciandro) show
        that bootleggers are really able to care about a nice
        outfit for their discs. The CD contains an excellent
        recording of the Critique show, the Toronto track is
        almost perfect, too. Despite the poor mistake about the
        Matrix tracks (no TV performance, of course!) this is a
        fine quality product for those of you who haven't got the
        tracks on other CDs available from the underground.</p>
