        <p>A mediocre CD with an interesting cover showing Val
        Kilmer instead of Jim Morrison. Interesting because the
        name The Doors is printed in silver letters on the
        plastic box. The songs are pretty well-known by now. The
        disc comes as a cheapo disc - nobody should pay more than
        $5 for it.<br>

        <p>The only Greek bootleg CD got vastly distributed in
        Europe. Although the material definitely is not
        interesting, bootleggers copied this one for the 3 CD box
        <i>Light My Fire</i> (Starlife ST 3606) and for the 2 CD
        box <i>Jim Morrison - Special Limited Edition</i>
        (Starlife ST 2905). The cover of the Starlife copy is the
        same, they just changed the order number.<br>

        <p>Finally, even the bootleggers have discovered the new
        media of CD-Rom. What is most astonishing about this
        release is the country of its release - Russia. The disc
        has just got a xeroxed black &amp; white cover with a
        Russian text on the back. The copy that I have is just a
        CD-R; a self-made computer copy. I have no idea if this
        is distributed as a real print as well. The content is
        surprising, too. There are 11 Doors videos on it (all
        taken from the official video Dance On Fire); there's a
        slide show overdubbed by the song The End and a Russian
        narrator; there are 62 (!) songs from The Doorsae
        official studio albums on it; there are the lyrics of all
        official songs; there are 73 nice (partly rare, üartly
        from Oliver Stone's film) photos in perfect quality and
        there's the introduction taken from the First Flash Of
        Eden bootleg (the announcer and a part of Back Door Man).
        Of course, the Russians made a few mistakes re-naming the
        videos: Texas Radio &amp; The Big Beat Vol.2 is nothing
        but Love Me Two Times, and Horse Latitudes is nothing but
        Moonlight Drive. On the other hand this would make a
        pretty good official interactive CD-ROM; the videos
        should be in better quality, though.<br>

        A luxurious glossy hardcover longbox containing 4 CDs, a
        beautiful 24-page booklet and a colour poster make one of
        the nicest Doors CD compilation boxes of all time. All
        four picture CDs and their covers had been designed
        individually. Sure, all tracks have been published on
        countless bootlegs before, but this seems to be the first
        attempt to produce an intelligentcompilation. For the
        first time somebody tried to publish a concept box, not
        just another uninteresting compilation. Despite a few
        tiny mistakes (check the sources) and the inclusion of a
        longer <i>Someday Soon</i> version (copied from <i>Live
        In Seattle</i>, Flashback Worldproductions 02.92.0170)
        and a short version (from <i>The Doors From The Inside</i>
        radio show, but the same concert), this box is a perfect
        collector's item. Some interesting liner notes and a list
        of 51 different Doors bootleg CDs including all their
        tracks made the booklet very attractive at the time of
        ist release. It also contains many photos, mostly from
        Frank Lisciandro's books and Danny Sugerman's <i>Illustrated
        History</i> book. The extra colour poster shows the
        covers of all 51 CDs mentioned. A great work. Although
        the box is pretty expensive, it is worth the money and
        without any doubt <b>recommended</b> for the true fan.<br>

        <p>This CD is a perfect example how to take a good
        quality radio show and produce something bad of it. First
        - they used a tape copy instead of the original vinyl
        show. Second - they fade in the songs and, of course,
        they fade out as well. Horrible! Buy <i>Canadian Night</i>
        (Buccaneer Records BUC 011) it has the same songs in
        better soundquality and no fades at all. Avoid Feel The
        Blues. Despite the rare photo on the front (reprinted in
        bad quality) from The Doors' 1968 <i>Top Of The Pops</i>
        appearance) there isn't anything good to say about this
        CD.<br>

        the songs. You know what? I am sure they will continue

        album. Just wait. This disc - like the first Fremus

        <p>First I thought this was a copy of one of the other <i>The
        Doors Live</i> CDs (More Record Production) but then I
        noticed the different source of the song <i>Light My Fire</i>
        and the omission of <i>The Celebration Of The Lizard</i>.
        But that doesn't matter. This too is just another useless
        compilation. Is it really necessary to mention that a
        copy with a red back cover was seen at a record fair?<br>

        <p>Fair enough, this useless CD has got an astonishingly
        good sound. All tracks have been published before on many
        other CDs. This is the version with the bar code on the
        backcover. The second edition has the same content, the
        same design on disc, the same backcover (without
        bar-code), but a totally different cover. It seems
        somebody is selling his uninteresting product twice. The
        cover of the second edition is worse than the one of the
        first edition.<br>

        CD with the same title. Needless to say, that this
        Italian CD is definitely not worth to be collected for
        the songs. <i>In Concert</i> was a great album for
        bootleggers - they couldn't wait to use its songs for
        their releases. No wonder the soundquality of the copies
        is superb. This CD is also known as <i>Golden Age - The
        Doors Live</i>.<br>

        If you own the box <i>The Complete Matrix Club Tapes</i>
        (KTS BX 009) you should be aware that this mid-price CD
        is a copy of disc #4 from the box. Fine cover, fine
        quality. Limited to 200 copies only.<br>
        Note: On the four nicely designed Oil Well midprice discs
        <i>Summer's Almost Gone</i> (RSC CD 114), <i>Moonlight
        Drive</i> (RSC CD 115), <i>Shake Your Moneymaker</i> (RSC
        CD 116) and <i>Down On Me</i> (RSC CD 117) you find the
        complete recordings of four sets at the Matrix Club, San
        Francisco, March 7th and March 10th, 1967. No wonder the
        first set of March 10th is still missed - those discs
        were copied from the great KTS box <i>The Complete Matrix
        Club Tapes</i>. Altogether they are cheaper than the box
        - so if you can't get that one, try to get the four.<br>

        As you see, one who owns the CDs <i>Orange County Suite</i>
        (Document Records DR 019) and <i>New York Blues</i>
        (Document Records DR 033) does not need this double CD,
        which uses parts of the original artwork of the single
        CDs. The CDs have exactly the same quality as the
        originals, no wonder - they were made from the same glass
        masters. While <i>New York Blues</i> is still a
        masterwork, we have a fine substitute for <i>Orange
        County Suite</i> now: <i>Missing Links</i> (Memorec 403)
        and <i>Jim Morrison - The Lost Paris Tapes</i> (Jomo
        3.5471.1). Alright?<br>

        <p>All songs of this CD had been copied from European
        bootleg CDs. For Japanese fans there might be interesting
        material on it, but for Europeans Dynamic Live is nothing
        special - just another compilation of well known
        material.</p>
