        A new Tuff Bites CD (their CDs are known for their
        significant caricature covers and their usual digipack
        design). This double CD comes in a digi-fold-out-pack and
        features the complete Doors 1970 Vancouver show (with
        guest guitarist bluesman Albert King on a few songs) plus
        4 songs from a 1968 performance in Chicago which has
        never been published before on disc. Therefore this
        double album is truly <b>recommended</b> - although some
        of you collectors might already have either <i>Canadian
        Night</i> (Buccaneer Records BUC 011) or <i>Vancouver 70</i>
        (Skeleton Records SKCD 1066) or both. But the Tuff Bites
        album features the complete concert (just one cut is
        audible between <i>Love Me Two Times</i> and <i>Little
        Red Rooster</i>) which means <i>Alabama Song</i> and <i>Love
        Me Two Times</i> are on there as well as a few little
        dialogues and instrument tunings between songs which were
        missed on all previous releases of this concert (check
        reviews of <i>Canadian Night</i> and <i>Vancouver 70</i>
        in <i>The Doors Quarterly #26</i>. In general - Jim
        Morrison is in a phantastic mood, his voice is stronger
        than ever. The Doors were really getting back to the
        blues with the help of Albert King's unmisakable guitar
        riffs. The highlights are <i>Little Red Rooster, Rock Me
        Baby, The End</i> and of course the best version of <i>Light
        My Fire</i> that has ever been published. The
        soundquality is excellent stereo.<br>
        The mono audience recording-quality of the bonus Chicago
        tracks is worse, but better than nothing. More important
        are the driving versions of <i>Soul Kitchen</i> (this
        time combined with a few lines from <i>Runnin' Blue</i>:
        &quot;<i>Poor Otis' dead and gone ...</i>&quot; and a
        child's prayer: &quot;<i>Now I lay me down to sleep ...</i>&quot;)
        and <i>Break On Through</i>. Also featured, one of the
        rare times Jim introduced the members of the band plus a
        few funny comments from some girls standing next to the
        recording microphone.<br>
        This double CD certainly should be on each hard core
        collector's shelf. A true document of one of the best
        Doors concerts in 1970 (just compare it to one of the
        worst concerts of the band, taped just one day earlier in
        Seattle, June 5th, 1970, presented on the otherwise
        excellent <i>Jim's Alive - The Ultimate Seattle Concert</i>
        (Tuff Bites T.B.94.1009). <b>Recommended</b>.<br>

        A very interesting interview CD, officially released in
        Australia. Actually, this is no bootleg, but published
        without The Doors' approval! It contains Tobler's own
        interview with Jim Morrison, taped a day after The Doors'
        Isle Of Wight concert.A copy of this tape was given to me
        by John Tobler a couple of years ago, and I still enjoy
        how Jim interrupted John's questions to hurry to the side
        of the stage in order to watch Jimi Hendrix perform
        (unfortunately this part of the tape is not on this CD).
        When Hendrix passed by Morrison said, &quot;<i>Look, an
        actual movie! Looks like a priest</i>!&quot; (Jimi was
        filmed while walking to the stage, to be seen in his
        official Isle of Wight video). The other interviews cover
        the story of the group and their topic is -
        surprise,surprise- Jim Morrison. This is an essential CD
        for each serious fan; it is great to hear Jim TALK. We
        didn't get much of that in the past ...<br>

        When this CD came out in 1988, it was a massive seller.
        It wasn't copied from the well known <i>Tangie Town
        Records</i> LP <i>Rock Is Dead</i> but from a high
        quality tape. At that time nobody knew it contained cut
        versions of the poetry and <i>Rock Is Dead</i>. Today we
        know better - just check <i>Missing Links</i> (Memorec
        403) and <i>Jim Morrison - The Lost Paris Tapes</i> (Jomo
        3.5471.1). But for the Felt Forum tracks this CD is still
        a fine product. <i>Light My Fire</i> is in excellent
        quality, and the intro '<i>When I was back there ...</i>'
        was used for the official <i>Absolutely Live</i> album,
        which later got published on CD as <i>In Concert</i>. The
        CD was made in Germany, mastered in Austria and got the
        copyrights cleared in Italy... a nice European product.
        Strange noise reduction system, though.</p>
