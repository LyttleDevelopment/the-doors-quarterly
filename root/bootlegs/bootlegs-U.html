        Finally a good bootleg CD for the collectors. This tape
        hasn't been published before (except some excerpts on the
        rare vinyl LP <i>Singing The Blues Vol.II</i>, and of
        course <i>The Soft Parade</i> on some bad <i>Critique</i>
        LPs and CDs), and I really like it. Well, the quality
        isn't that good, but it doesn't matter that much. After
        all those rip-offs, there's a CD with (for collectors)
        new material on, and although this Winterland concert
        (the cover says it was taped in Monterey, which is not
        true, but there are some tape copies around labeled <i>Monterey</i>;
        most likely the CD was made from one of those) wasn't one
        of The Doors' best concerts, it is a perfect example how
        the band sounded on a pretty normal night. I like how Ray
        interrupted the ill-fated <i>Close To You</i> (dead from
        the beginning) &quot;<i>We lost it, we lost it...</i>&quot;,
        and how he started the next song, a mindblowing version
        of <i>Manish Boy</i>. Yes, guys, it's Jim in the
        background, but it's Ray's song, his old <i>Screaming Ray
        Daniels</i>' song, the one he did many times with <i>Rick
        And The Ravens</i> at the Turkey Joint West in Santa
        Monica. A great and powerful version. The addition of the
        song <i>The Soft Parade</i> wasn't really necessary at
        all, and its quality is better on the official video.
        Summary: A nice CD (if you don't expect the best sound),
        nice cover, and - a never before published (bootlegged)
        Doors concert. A very rare and hard to get bootleg CD.<br>

        Telling people the tracks were taped in the USA (but half
        of the CD's songs weren't!), mixing one track into
        another, using an official album photo for the cover (the
        fold-out photo of <i>Morrison Hotel</i>) and giving Eddie
        Vedder the first tracks of a Doors bootleg without
        mentioning him on the cover leads to the following short
        comment: Don't buy this rip-off product.</p>
