        This is the CD-version of the famous US Double-LP-album <i>Roadhouse
        Blues</i>, fairly good soundquality. I wish the
        bootleggers would have copied the sound from the European
        LP album <i>Bring Out Your Dead</i> instead from the US
        copy. Anyway, if you don't have this blend of two Felt
        Forum concerts from January 17th and 18th, 1970, on
        vinyl, this CD is the right choice for you, because it is
        quite cheap on record fairs.<br>

        A fascinating live CD, almost as good as the official
        live albums. All tracks are presented in fine quality and
        you listen to exciting versions of a Doors fan's
        favourite songs. Document Records used a good quality
        tape for the CD and fans will thank them for the unusual
        cover, which shows a <b>bearded</b> Morrison, but he did
        not have beard at the Felt Forum shows. The picture - by
        the way - was taken during The Doors' Isle Of Wight
        performance. <i>New York Blues</i> has not the same
        tracks as <i>Build Me A Woman</i> (Great Dane Records GDR
        8908) or <i>New York 1970</i> (Stentor Sten 91.001).
        Somehow somebody put several songs from three shows
        together and distributed the tape, so usually all Felt
        Forum CDs are a big mess of songs from three different
        concerts.<br>

        Still, after all those years, the Frankfurt concert is an
        uninspired standard concert of a band that was at the
        peak of their career. With a best-selling single, <i>Hello
        I Love You</i>, and a best-selling album, <i>Waiting For
        The Sun</i>, in the background The Doors began their
        European tour doing four celebrated concerts in London
        together with the psychedelic sounds of Jefferson
        Airplane. In Frankfurt, the next stop, it was all
        different. There were people attending their two concerts
        who didn't speak English at all or didn't get what The
        Doors were doing. There were yelling GIs from the
        surrounding military stations and patiently listening
        other Americans. It was hard for the band to get in
        contact with the audience, especially after the driving
        boogie of their support band, Canned Heat. The Doors were
        too different. Jim wasn't feeling well because he had
        drunk too much <i>Goldener Oktober</i> (a cheap German
        wine) in the afternoon of the same day. So - that's it.
        The people left and never came back. They missed the
        second show which is said to have been much better (read
        more about the Frankfurt shows and The Doors in Germany
        in DQ 36). <i>The Night On Fire</i> was a widely
        distributed German vinyl bootleg in the early 80's (now
        this album reaches prices at about DM 200). This CD was
        made from a low-genera- tion tape with no cuts (no
        crackles and no surface noise can be heard, so I guess it
        was not taken from a vinyl copy). The sound is better
        than on the vinyl.<br>
        A surprise is the CD's bonus track - an interview
        conducted by two local DJs from Oswego, New York, Steve
        Flesser and Mike Lezard. The interview was held before
        The Doors went on-stage at the Pierce College, September
        15, 1967. Steve and Mike are struggling hard to get their
        standard questions answered. After The Doors (especially
        Jim and Ray) noticed that the interviewers were not
        interested in the band's music and their message but in
        how many copies of the singles and the album were sold,
        how much money the group gets for a single, how was
        touring and stuff, they started making fools of both DJs.
        Here are some examples: &quot;<i>Is there something you
        can say to all your listeners - what could it be</i>?&quot;
        &quot;<i>Fuck</i>,&quot; is the answer. Jim says:
        &quot;I'm Steve Flesser, and I'm listening to the Jim
        Morrison-show&quot;. &quot;<i>My name is Jim of the
        Doors, when I'm in town you'll always listen to the Mike
        Lizard-show.</i>&quot; Ray: &quot;<i>I listen to the
        Steve Blesser-show, whenever I'm in town - which is
        rarely</i>!&quot; and &quot;<i>Steve Flesser is what's
        happening. Mike Lezard is also happening</i>.&quot;<br>
        The CD cover and booklet has got a nice design inspired
        by the old vinyl cover using the same pictures and golden
        letters. The CD itself is gold plated and has got a
        picture of Jim's bust on it.<br>

        Elektra Records made a big mistake with the release of
        their <i>Live At The Hollywood Bowl</i> CD in 1987: On
        this there were just 6 songs from the simultaneously
        published video. Of course the bootleggers took their
        chance to produce CDs with the extra tracks. <i>The Night
        On Fire</i> CD is in absolute Hifi stereo soundquality
        and shouldn't be mixed up with the rare vinyl LP bearing
        the same name - on that one was The Doors Frankfurt
        concert. For people who haven't got the video (or a hifi
        stereo video player) or the official EP I really
        recommend this CD. It was made in West Germany, but the
        copyright problems got cleared in Italy.<br>

        At least they put the date and the place of performance
        right: <i>January 18th, 1970 at the Felt Forum</i>
        (except <i>Build Me A Woman</i> which was recorded a day
        earlier). Out goes the message: if you don't own <i>New
        York Blues</i> (Document Records DR 033) and <i>Orange
        County Suite</i> (Document Records DR 019) and if you
        want to listen to this concert, <i>No Future</i> would be
        the right choice, and the quality is pretty much better,
        too.<br>
