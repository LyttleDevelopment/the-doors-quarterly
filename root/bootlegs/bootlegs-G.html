        <p>This very strange CD puts together artists who have
        got nothing to do with each other. Sure we know Scott
        Walker, the ex-singer of The Walker Brothers (his real
        name was Scott Engel), and some of you might know Harold
        Budd, who worked a lot with Brian Eno. But why the hell
        are those guys featured with some bonus tracks on a Doors
        CD? Of course this CD is a bootleg, and somebody took a
        SCRATCHED copy of his Prayer-vinyl album and put this on
        CD with two other artists as guest stars. Yes, listen to
        all those nice crackles that make a vinyl album worth to
        listen to - but this time they're on CD! If you like to
        listen to <i>An American Prayer</i> in front of your
        fireplace, you don't need the fireplace anymore: it's
        already featured on your copy of <i>Ghost Songs On Dawn's
        Highway</i>. The Walker/Budd tracks are interesting,
        though, and without crackles. I really don't want to
        comment the <i>An American Prayer</i> album now, it's
        very very good, as we all know, it is a perfect poetry
        album, probably the album Jim really had in mind when he
        went to record his poetry (but probably without The
        Doors. If you buy this bootleg, The Doors won't get the
        royalties they deserve for making <i>An American Prayer</i>,
        so - honestly - out goes the message: <i>DON'T BUY THIS
        RIP-OFF CALLED 'DAWN'S HIGHWAY'. IT'S SHIT! Run into your
        local record store and buy the original Elektra CD</i>!<br>

        <p>An edition of Aulica's <i>Go Insane</i> double set
        (originally in a beautiful longbox foldout cover). This
        time the two discs come in a silk box, with an especially
        designed label, and the paper ribbon around the box makes
        it look very Japanese, but it is not from Japan at all.
        It's another Italian attempt to make money (Japanese
        boots are usually very expensive). That's why they also
        tell us it was a limited numbered edition for the
        collector ... aehm - but they did not bother to correct
        the names of the songs. <i>So Do It</i> is still called<i>
        Let It Bleed</i>, and <i>Summertime</i> is still called <i>No
        Limits No Laws</i>. And I still do <i>NOT</i> recommend
        this double CD Box, even if it has got another packing.
        By the way, same packing was used for many other Aulica
        CDs featuring other artists.<br>

        <p>A good example how <i>clever</i> Italian bootleggers
        can be. Selling two crap CDs in two beautiful deluxe
        longboxes, both carefully designed, is in fact very
        clever! If there was a competition for the best
        bootleg-cover, they would certainly win the prize! It
        takes a lot of work to get through all those little
        doors, windows, folders and bags to find the CDs, and it
        also takes some time to rearrange all those cover
        foldings. If there weren't those two boxes nobody would
        have bought the shit inside. This shit is presented on
        two individually designed CDs, by the way. Every average
        Doors fan should know by now that The Doors never
        recorded any track named <i>Let It Bleed</i> or <i>No
        Limits No Laws</i>. But the cover really is amazing and
        the whole set is pretty expensive.<br>
        But because of the misleading labeling of the tracks I
        certainly don't recommend the set. The content stinks.<br>

        <p>Like the other <i>Los Grandes Del Rock</i>, this one
        was a supplement for a Spanish magazine. Intentionally
        falsified titles, fade-ins and -outs and very common
        material are signatures of a bad CD. At least they got
        the dates right! A copy of <i>No Limits</i> (Fabbri
        Editori MRL 003, Italy 1993).</p>
