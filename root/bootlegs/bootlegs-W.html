        the Seattle bootleg CD bearing the same title (Ghe-San

        <p>Well, this has got the same tracks and almost the same
        soundquality, but (compared to the one above) it is much
        worse. The bootleggers didn't care that much about how to
        edit the tracks. They fade in, they fade out, first notes
        and last notes of the songs are cut off. But if you can
        get <i>Jim's Alive - The Ultimate Seattle Tapes</i> (Tuff
        Bites T.B.941009), forget this one. I also dislike the
        cover which reproduces the tasteless Rolling Stone
        &quot;Wanted&quot;-poster, but with a colour photo.<br>

        Another rip-off. Yes, you have to be really careful about
        most of the releases from the underground. This one
        contains most of the tracks from the official <i>Live At
        The Hollywood Bowl</i> video (I still wonder why The
        Doors put out just a part of that concert on CD and
        almost the complete concert on videotape: what a feast
        for CD bootleggers!) along with two abbreviated songs
        from their Vancouver concert with Albert King (both taken
        from the radio-show <i>The Doors From The Inside</i>). <i>Who
        Do You Love</i> is just <b>24 seconds long</b> (!),
        unbelievable! I hope nobody bought this rubbish!<br>

        <p>World Productions Of Compact Music are known for
        rather good covers but bad soundquality. Same goes for
        this CD. At the time of ist release, there were quite
        many vinyl bootlegs out which were in much better
        quality. For example - the <i>Critique</i> show was
        better on the first US LP bootleg pressing with the same
        title, and the interview with all four Doors was
        presented the best on the first US pressing of the LP <i>Mr
        Mojo Risin'</i>. For this CD they used scratched copies
        of Italian reprints of the vinyls mentioned before. Pity!
        The demos are interesting, but the soundquality is much
        better on the very sought-after <i>Run Free</i> bootleg
        from Italy. The cover shows an interesting live shot of
        an early Doors performance at the Fillmore Auditorium in
        New York with a psychedelic projection behind the group,
        but the picture was copied from the German <i>Celebration</i>
        double bootleg album. So everything on this bootleg got
        copied from vinyl releases! None of the tracks is in
        stereo (as indicated on the cover), and sources and dates
        are mislabeled; most likely not intentionally, the
        bootleggers simply did not know it better.<br>

        <p>Of course this is <b>NOT</b> their performance at <i>Westbury
        Music Fair </i>in early 1968, as the people <i>Octopus/Why
        Not</i> want to tell you. Simply have a look at the track
        list: <i>Roadhouse Blues</i> and <i>Peace Frog</i>
        performed in 1968??? I simply hate mislabelled CDs. So -
        if you have the glorious <i>New York Blues</i> (Document
        Records DR 033) and <i>Orange County Suite</i> (Document
        Records DR 019), you have got the tracks already - in
        even better soundquality. Do not let the bootleggers fool
        you and simply ignore this rip off!<br>

        <p>It's getting boring to see all those illegal releases
        of official albums, to tell you the truth. This is
        another boring example of how to rip off people. This
        company called Sarabandas usually takes tracks from live
        radio shows, but this time they took all tracks from The
        Doors' official album <i>In Concert</i> (as they did for
        their release <i>Light My Fire</i>, Sarabandas 12015). Of
        course the quality of this CD is excellent, the graphic
        artwork of the cover is enjoyable, but in general this is
        just another way to grasp money from fans and collectors.
        Why don't you steal this CD instead of buying it? Those
        bootleggers stole the music from an official release,
        right?<br>

        (HAWK 042), this low-price CD is the right choice for
        you. The concert's soundquality is slightly better than
        on the HAWK-CD, and the CD is out for low-price. The
        three tracks are also available on countless Pearl Jam
        bootleg CDs.</p>
