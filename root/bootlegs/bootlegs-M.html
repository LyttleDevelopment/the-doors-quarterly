        Another release of the Matrix concerts, but this time in
        better quality than the first bootleg LP version <i>Moonlight
        Drive - The Scream Of The Butterfly</i>. The Swingin'
        Pigs used the new &quot;Nonoise&quot; computer based
        digital noise reduction system. This drastically reduces
        all unwanted noises on older recordings but cuts off the
        high frequencies. It's true: no surface noise, and the
        soundquality is a lot better than on all other Matrix
        bootlegs, with the exception of the 4 CD Box <i>The
        Complete Matrix Club Tapes</i> (Kiss The Stone KTS BX
        009), which I prefer to the Swingin' Pig release because
        of better quality and a couple of extra songs. This - in
        fact - is a big minus for <i>The Matrix Tapes</i>: each
        song is just once on them, which means songs they played
        twice during different sets were omitted. There were two
        pressings of this box - the first came in a double CD
        box, the second got released in a slim box carrying a
        white tray. The second pressing was sold as a cheap
        mid-price box and got widely distributed.<br>

        This CD is a MUST for everyone who is interested in The
        Doors. I really do not know how I could live without a
        recording of this session, which I consider as the very
        missing link between <i>Waiting For The Sun, The Soft
        Parade</i> and <i>Morrison Hotel</i>. You know there was
        the bootleg LP <i>Rock Is Dead</i> (Tangie Town Records)
        and there was the bootleg <i>Orange County Suite</i>
        (Document Records DR 019), which were absolutely
        fantastic at the time of their release, but now there is <i>Missing
        Links</i>. Unfortunately the soundquality is not as good
        as the latter ones, but <i>Missing Links</i> contains the
        <b>COMPLETE</b> <i>Rock Is Dead</i> session, and one will
        be wondering how perfectly Paul Rothchild cut the session
        down to what became the well-known <i>Rock Is Dead</i>
        (and <i>Orange County Suite</i>) bootleg, and how all the
        cut-outs sound like. He even put parts of the session
        together, which were not intended being put together (but
        they fit!). If you own one of the previous bootlegs, it's
        like a puzzle finding out what was cut out. A very new
        experience, even for me. Finally released after about two
        years of waiting for it I still get a thrill listening to
        <i>Queen Of The Magazines</i> (I still don't know who
        wrote the song; it sounds a bit like <i>Love In Vain</i>
        by Robert Johnson, to which Jim Morrison improvises some
        of his own lyrics; to tell you the truth: I got tears in
        my eyes when I first heard it a couple of years ago and
        it is still very very touching me). Robert Johnson's <i>Me
        And The Devil Blues</i> (with some spontaneous Morrison
        improvisations) still is a perfect moody blues song.
        Jim's rap about his parents at the beginning of the
        session gets a totally new meaning compared to what was
        published on previous bootlegs. I wonder why the
        bootlegger didn't cut out the short break in (what he
        called) <i>Rock Is Dead #2</i> (if you put this disc on
        tape for your car stereo try to cut the break off, it's
        easy!). There is another break in <i>Rock Me Baby</i>,
        which would have been easy to cut off the disc, but
        -unfortunately- it's on your CD as well. On the <i>Missing
        Links</i> version I have the disc index stops after track
        10, so my CD player doesn't count track 11-14, but you
        shouldn't worry: It seems the bootlegger just forgot to
        put a disc memory on the following tracks, so track 10
        really is track 10-14. On the first preview tape I got of
        this session (which never came out on bootleg) there were
        no breaks at all, and there was some additional poetry,
        but no <i>Whiskey, Mystics And Men #1</i>. I enjoy the
        liner notes for this CD, they even mention what Jim told
        Jerry Hopkins during the well known interview for <i>Rolling
        Stone</i> about this session: &quot;<i>We needed another
        song for The Soft Parade. We were racking our brains
        trying to think what song. We were in the studio and so
        we started throwing out all those old songs. Blues trips.
        Rock Classics. Finally we just started playing and we
        played for about an hour, and we went through the whole
        history of rock music - starting with blues, going
        through rock and roll, surf music, latin, the whole
        thing. I call it `Rock Is Dead'. I doubt if anybody'll
        ever hear it.</i>&quot; Jim was wrong. Rock Is Dead was
        one of the hottest bootlegs in town (once a discjockey
        from L.A. told his audience), but now there is <i>Missing
        Links</i>, even hotter. Well written linernotes, by the
        way. One of the hottest bootleg CDs in town ever!
        Absolutely <b>recommended</b>.<br>

        This CD is a remake of the 1994 <i>Missing Links</i> CD
        and it looks exactly the same but has got 3 bonus tracks
        which are not mentioned on the cover or on the CD (track
        15-17). To distinguish both versions check the CD: this
        new version has got the OSA sign while the 1994 version
        without bonus tracks has got GEMA on the CD. The
        soundquality is exactly the same. For review, please
        check <i>The Doors Quarterly</i> #30.<br>

        Needless to say, that everybody who owns a copy of <i>Missing
        Links</i> does not need this Italian disc. The sound is
        worse, and the Italians even copied the liner notes from <i>Missing
        Links</i> (they just erased the words <i>Missing Links</i>
        and also the name of the guy who wrote the notes, some <i>Philippe
        Auguste</i>). So this is a copy of a bootleg. Nice New
        York '68 photo of Jim on the cover, though.<br>

        Most of the songs on this CD were taken from the bootleg
        LP <i>Someday Soon</i> (Do It Records) released in 1989
        in Germany, which was a great album at the time. When I
        got <i>More Missing Links</i> I first thought this CD was
        made by a Doors fan, but then the track <i>Let It Bleed</i>
        told me it wasn't. No Doors fan would call <i>Do It</i>
        from the album <i>The Soft Parade</i> &quot;<i>Let It
        Bleed</i>&quot;. When the hell does this nonsense stop?
        Some tracks on <i>More Missing Links</i> are rare, such
        as the acetate and the Rick And The Ravens singles, but
        those songs will be in better quality (not that many
        crackles!) on the Italian box <i>Stages</i>. So this CD,
        which was definitely not made by the people who did the
        original <i>Missing Links</i> (Memorial Records Memorec
        403), is nothing but a mediocre compilation and not worth
        the money. The disc was made in Japan and - astonishingly
        - got distributed from Holland.<br>

        <p>The CD looks like a star on Hollywood Boulevard, and
        it is gold plated. Hmmm. Although it was the first gold
        plated Doors bootleg CD, all the material on it had been
        heard before in much better quality, and the people from <i>Missing
        In Action</i> are as silly as the Aulica guys. Songs are
        mislabelled, songs are cut drastically, fade-ins,
        fade-outs, as usual. Definitely not an essential bootleg,
        not at all. Tasteful design, though. The booklet shows an
        unpublished colour photo from the Roundhouse, London,
        1968. But the whole thing is no must for any collector.<br>

        The cover of this CD doesn't give you any dates or
        venues, so this list is pretty useful. It doesn't even
        mention Eddie Vedder's name as the singer for the Doors
        at their Hall Of Fame concert. The quality is OK, the '93
        stuff even is in stereo, and forget the rest of it, which
        has been published many times before. There are a few
        Doors bootlegs featuring this special performance, but I
        prefer one of the countless Pearl Jam boots like <i>Eddie
        Sings The Doors</i> and all this crap. This CD was one of
        the first presented in a clear box (the tray was made of
        clear plastic), really fashionable. At least that was
        something new. Short comment on the performance: the
        group sounds like a second-hand tribute band.<br>

        This Japanese disc (distributed from Holland) was copied
        from <i>Missing Links</i> (Memorial Records, Memorec
        403), but this time featuring bonus tracks which
        everybody already knows. If you own <i>Missing Links</i>,
        you certainly do not need this one.</p>
