        <p>Although everybody should have heard the stuff before,
        this collection of songs is pretty well selected. I enjoy
        the quality of the different tapes the bootleggers used
        and I simply love the cover. Good exciting songs on this
        CD, not interesting for insiders who have already got <i>Jim's
        Alive</i> (Tuff Bites T.B.94.1009), <i>Vancouver 70</i>
        (Skeleton SKCD 1066) or <i>Canadian Nights</i> (Buccaneer
        Records BUC 011) or <i>Live In Vancouver</i> (Sounds
        Alive SA 24.020) and <i>New York 1970</i> (Stentor
        91.001), but <i>Rarities And Few</i> is the perfect
        addition to the official <i>In Concert</i> double CD. It
        took some time finding out the sources: they are not
        mentioned on the cover, but - as I've said - nothing new
        for the hard-core fan.<br>

        admit. A blue door, a red wall and a Morrison photo: nice
        artwork.. Unfortunately this CD was obviously copied from
        a vinyl bootleg. Therefore the sound is not as good as on
        most other Stockholm CDs.<br>

        <p>One of the worst Doors CDs ever! Same rubbish as <i>Archangel</i>
        and <i>The Future Is Murder</i>, made by the same
        bootlegger using a different name. Another digipack,
        looking pretty average, but the CD is a horror for the
        real fan. This bootlegger honestly wants to tell us that
        five songs on this CD were recorded in New Orleans,
        December 12th 1970! No, they certainly aren't, Sir, and
        we're not gonna take it. A first-rate rip-off, and we can
        be sure this idiot (or is he just clever?) is going to
        produce some more of this shit. He overdubbed studio
        songs from the <i>Weird Scenes Inside The Goldmine</i>
        album plus spoken poems from the <i>Requiem For The
        Americas album</i>, which is still out on CD and LP
        (Requiem For The Americas, Songs From The Lost World,
        Enigma Records 773354-2, 1989), with some fake audience
        noise and bang: It was &quot;<i>recorded LIVE in New
        Orleans</i>&quot;! He mixed Jim's voice onto other songs
        (spoken stuff runs too slow, by the way) which gives a
        horrible uneven blend. Like on <i>The Future Is Murder</i>
        (Alien Records 006) all songs and poetry have been
        published before and are still easy to obtain on original
        albums or bootleg CDs. This shabby CD is not worth a
        penny! <b>Treat it like dogs' shit!</b><br>

        At that time (1988) this CD was fabulous for those who
        just had the official EP Live At The Hollywood Bowl,
        because The Riot Show contained all extra songs from the
        video in excellent quality. Today this is very average
        material, and this CD is - after such a long time - sold
        out. By the way - there is no other CD around containing
        the Jonathan Winter tracks in a six-star soundquality!<br>
