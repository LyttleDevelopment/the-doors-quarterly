        <p>This was sponsored by Carolco International and
        Tri-Star Pictures. So it is not really what you would
        call a bootleg. But there are live versions on it, so
        just check your copy of <i>A Tribute To Jim Morrison</i>.
        The CD was a supplement for the French magazine Max, but
        dealers now sell it individually for a lot of money.<br>

        The original vinyl version is a first grade collectors'
        item. And so will be the CD which came out in a limited
        edition. For the CD the producers used the same photo and
        artwork but this time in colour. Great picture! My
        favourite record cover of all times! The sound is much
        better than on <i>Freedom Man</i> (Banzai Records BZBX
        036/37/38) and - of course - this was a good concert. I
        still cannot understand why the biography <i>No One Here
        Gets Out Alive</i> says it was a bad one! Notice the
        unusual medley during <i>The End</i>. I can't remember
        any other version of <i>The End</i> featuring <i>Wake Up</i>.
        The CD is different from the vinyl: All that guitar
        tuning and all those audience noises are included this
        time. Both the vinyl and the CD miss the encore, which
        was <i>Roadhouse Blues</i>. Instead of that on the CD
        there is a bonus track from Denver 1967 which has not
        been published before. The song sounds as if this was
        taped miles away from the stage, but it is truly a
        fantastic mindblowing version of <i>Light My Fire</i> and
        totally new to everybody. Absolutely: <b>Recommended</b>!<br>

        The cover is nice, showing a collage of the four group
        members in front of doors. That's the only good thing
        about this CD. The sound of the Copenhagen performance is
        just horrible. Nobody would recommend this CD.<br>

        Except for a few song segments during <i>The End</i> and <i>Moonlight
        Drive</i> and the version of <i>When The Music's Over</i>
        on disc 3, track 1, the &quot;normal&quot; collector does
        not have the material published in this box. The three
        CDs are recommended for the collector who is not
        interested in bootleg compilation CDs. The Felt Forum
        concert is the only <u>complete</u> recording of one
        single Felt Forum concert which is around (on all other
        previously published CDs the tracks are compiled from
        three different shows, as I've recently found out. By the
        way, until now no recording of the first Felt Forum show
        on January 17th, 1970 has shown up). Interesting enough,
        the version of <i>Moonlight Drive</i> was used for <i>Alive
        She Cried</i> (later on <i>In Concert</i>), and <i>Universal
        Mind</i> was used for <i>Absolutely Live</i> (later used
        for <i>In Concert</i> as well), but on this CD you have
        the complete version including a fantastic organ solo by
        Ray Manzarek. I can't believe Paul Rothchild cut this out
        while putting <i>Absolutely Live</i> together! In
        general, a fine show, although Jim says before <i>Light
        My Fire</i>, &quot;<i>I thank you all for being so
        patient with us tonight. It usually takes an hour or so
        to get warmed up, so I don't plan the rest to go any but
        for a while ... what if we'll do a famous radio song</i>?&quot;
        But - a very boring version of <i>Light My Fire</i>
        follows, unfortunately. <i>When The Music's Over</i> is
        slightly better, and if you listen carefully you'll
        notice that this Felt Forum version was used as the basic
        track for the one on <i>Absolutely Live</i> with a few
        overdubs here and there - especially the <i>Shut Up!</i>
        phrase, which has definitely been cut into the Felt Forum
        version of January 18th, first show. The original tape
        runs too slowly, by the way. The bootleggers didn't
        bother to correct the speed, unfortunately ...<br>
        The second CD in this box has got songs from The Doors'
        Long Beach concert on it. Unfortunately the quality is
        very bad (the master tape seems to have being recorded
        200 meters away from the stage), and half of the concert
        is not on this CD - I miss <i>Universal Mind, Crystal
        Ship, Touch Me</i> and <i>The End</i>. But The Doors and
        their audience are in the best mood ever, Jim is giving a
        good rap to the audience, and if not for its historical
        importance this concert represents one of the better
        shows the band gave to a big audience (remember the
        disastrous Seattle concert?). <i>Music's Over</i>
        (17'32&quot; long!) is much much better than the version
        from the first CD of this box, but it's very hard to get
        what Jim is telling the audience - the quality of the
        recording is awful. The order of the songs on the CD is
        not as The Doors played them - they started with <i>Roadhouse
        Blues. Blue Sunday</i> is the only live version of this
        lovely tune available, nice one, Jim! The third CD starts
        with <i>Music's Over</i> from Long Beach, then it fades
        into The Doors' Isle Of Wight performance. I'm shocked
        the quality is so bad; it really sucks - there are much
        better tapes around, and if you have the bootleg LP or CD
        <i>First Flash Of Eden</i> on Tangie Town Records - good,
        the quality is best on that one.<br>
        The box contains an excellent 52-page (!) booklet with
        many color photos (most of them taken by Frank
        Lisciandro), an interesting but jerkily written article
        about the last year of Doors concerts (1970) plus a few
        snippets of Morrison-poetry. Probably the best booklet
        ever produced for a bootleg box.<br>
        This box is <b>recommended</b> <i>because of the rarity
        of the material and the beautiness of the cover and the
        booklet</i>, but certainly <b>not</b> for the sound
        quality.<br>

        I still get a manic depression when I notice how the
        bootleggers mistitled and mislabeled most of the tracks.
        Almost all tracks were taken from a tape copy of the
        radio show <i>The Doors From The Inside</i>, a famous and
        absolutely amazing show done in 1988 by Jac Holzman,
        former president of Elektra Records. The rest of the
        songs is known from some of the official videos. But
        telling people on the cover that The Doors are performing
        songs like <i>Mother</i> and <i>Let It Bleed</i> is
        absolutely bad and done just to raise the sales of this
        unbearable CD. You should watch your <i>Dance On Fire</i>
        and <i>Live At The Hollywood Bowl</i> videos, listen to
        your original CDs and the recommended CD boots in this
        book, then you have got all things which are on this CD
        and the soundquality is very much better. This Italian
        release is nothing but a rip off. Unfortunately <i>From
        The Inside - Live And Unreleased</i> was the source many
        other bootleggers copied their rip offs from - without
        questioning the correctness of titles and sources. Damn
        it!<br>

        <p>Another rip off, containing intentionally mislabeled
        material. Don't let this bootlegger fool you - this is
        material almost every serious fan already has. Despite
        the nice cover, this CD is not worth your money. It was
        made in Slovakia, the only country in Europe that still
        was pressing bootlegs during the autumn and winter 1995.
        So this is not really a true Slovakian release, it was
        just made there (check the carefully wiped-off
        registration number on the disc). <i>Never before
        released</i> is written on the cover - never believe this
        when you see a bootleg!<br>

        <p>After everybody had read in <i>The Doors Quarterly #29</i>
        the first issue from 1993 was pure shit, the news got
        around and nobody bought it anymore. So the bootlegger
        used another dirty trick: He threw away the old
        digi-packs, bought new black jewel boxes, had three
        colorful stickers printed and stuck them onto the box. He
        left out the <i>&quot;The&quot;</i> from the previous
        title <i>(The Future Is Murder)</i> and is now hoping
        that the fans will buy his shabby CD another time. No, we
        won't, <i>Mr. German Records</i>, alias <i>Mr. Alien
        Records</i>, alias <i>Mr. Fun Factory</i>, and we won't
        even buy another repackage of your awful <i>Replica Blues</i>-shit
        and your horrible <i>Archangel</i>-rubbish. I do not need
        to mention that this CD too features songs labeled <i>Live
        In New Orleans</i> (see other CDs mentioning this
        source). How many synonyms do you know for excrements,
        dear readers? Well, use them all for <i>Future Is Murder</i>!<br>

        <p>One of the worst CDs in the world. As you can see in
        this huge list above, this German bootleg CD is a total
        rip-off, trying to pretend to have good and unusual
        material on it. But there isn't any note on it which
        hasn't been published before on countless other bootleg
        records and CDs. Using songs from official Doors albums
        and videos, adding some audience noises and Morrison
        poems don't neccessarily make a good bootleg album. Even
        worse: Telling people some of the stuff was recorded in
        New Orleans (which was last Doors concert with Jim
        Morrison). Well, it is just a poem from the well-known <i>Rock
        Is Dead</i> album/the well-known <i>Orange County Suite</i>
        CD (Document Records DR 019). Most of the poetry'
        intercuts and overdubs run too slow! A few songs are cut:
        the bootlegger made his own short versions. Collectors
        might be interested in getting one of the first digipacks
        in bootleg CD history, but I hope nobody is going to buy
        this shit. The material was intentionally falsified and
        mislabeled to make fans think they have bought some rare
        stuff. Absolutely not worth the money! Avoid it! See <i>Future
        Is Murder, Archangel</i> and <i>Replica Blues</i>. For
        shit like these CDs they cut down rainforests and pollute
        our environment with plastic!</p>
