        size="3" face="Calibri">Back into the past with The Doors
        Quarterly Magazine #16, which got published on December
        15, 1987.<br>
        Just a few news items here in my 2019 intro for this
        issue, mainly the forthcoming Robby Krieger Gibson
        guitar, that actually<br>
        came out in 1988 as a limited edition. Furthermore, in
        addition to this DQ there was the Doors tape and video
        list (cassettes<br>
        only) Ray Manzarek had asked me to write when he wanted
        to see what was out and circulating at the time.<br>
        <br>
        Unfortunately my plans to produce a Doors Interview
        Flexidisc (you know -or probably don't- those flexible
        7&quot; discs, pressed<br>
        on thin plastic) failed, because the costs for
        materialising the idea were incredibly high in those
        days; I could not afford it.<br>
        I guess a fanclub flexi would be quite worth a lot of
        money nowadays, right?<br>
        <br>
        I still like my &quot;Merchandising &amp; The Doors&quot;
        article, which got illustrated by four girls on page two
        wearing some nice -meanwhile<br>
        rare- T-Shirts.One of the finest articles of all:
        &quot;Jim Morrison, When the Music's over - A personal
        remembrance&quot;, written by<br>
        Jim's friend Tom Baker. I forgot to include the
        publishing credits, it was from a magazine called High
        Times in June of 1981. It's<br>
        interesting to read some details of their first meetings,
        their abuse of alcohol, their adventures with strange
        groupies, Tom's<br>
        flight to Phoenix with Jim and how Tom experienced Jim's
        last day in L.A. together with Babe Hill and himself, and
        also his<br>
        last meeting with Pamela after Jim's death. Recommended
        reading!<br>
        <br>
        The famous John Densmore phone interview with Billy
        Pinnell from 1985 Part One is featured in this issue,<br>
        as is Part One of Scott Hyder's Symbolic Study of Jim
        Morrison.<br>
        <br>
        My article series &quot;Bootlegging The Doors&quot; has
        become a basic series of writings on how to identify
        different pressings of vinyl<br>
        records, this time concentrating on one of the most
        essential booties, &quot;Mr. Mojo Risin'&quot;; its very
        first pressing came from<br>
        the USA, published in the winter of 1980.<br>
        <br>
        I'm sorry to say that after publishing we found out that
        the &quot;Original Jim Morrison handwriting of 'End of
        the Night'&quot; on page 38<br>
        was fake. Please do not copy or distribute it saying it's
        in Jim's own hand.<br>
        <br>
        For producing this DQ 16 there was no computer around
        -everything got typed on my ancient electric typewriter-
        and the bigger<br>
        letters for headings used to be rub-off letters on small
        plastic sheets or plastic lettering tapes. There was a
        free (old) poster with<br>
        it, but I forgot which one of the about 20 different DQ
        posters available I had used for DQ 16. It came along
        with a small book<br>
        listing about 150 different Doors cassette tapes (I still
        own all of my old cassette tapes, btw.).<br>
        <br>
        Enjoy your digital version and let us know what you think
        ... we will continue soon by publishing a digital version
        of DQ 15. <br>
        Thanks to Kevin Chiotis for all of his work!<br>
        A splendid time is guaranteed for all!<br>
        <br>
        Please note that your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly
        Magazine 16 hasn't been altered in any way. You get it as
        it was<br>
        published in December 1987 (!). Be aware that all
        addresses (private, phone including my own address in
        this issue on page 3)<br>
        are certainly no longer valid anymore. Books, vinyl
        records, CDs and other stuff might not be available
        anymore. Please do not<br>
        respond to any of the small ads or blame anyone for
        incorrect details - all writers just did the best they
        could do back in late 1987.<br>
        And all this happened without any computer, without any
        emails and of course without the internet.<br>
        <br>
        PS: ... if you would like to obtain an original paper
        copy of this Doors Quarterly Magazine 16 I have to tell
        you that<br>
        unfortunately there are no copies left at all!<br>
        Thank you!<br>
