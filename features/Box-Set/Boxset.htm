        collector of Doors material on tapes, LPs, singles and
        CDs from all countries and sources I was appalled by the
        lack of really interesting new material on The Box Set.
        In their archives there are tons of live concerts
        recorded for Absolutely Live, there are plenty of
        alternative versions of published songs, there is a lot
        of unpublished but recorded material (like the studio
        version of Celebration Of The Lizard, the bluesy Paris
        Blues, or lost songs they mentioned during interviews
        like Luther And The Apostle and Happy For A Night And A
        Day, early versions of Peace Frog and unedited versions
        of The End, plus the unheard jam of Van and Jim Morrison
        doing Gloria at the Whisky A Go Go). Where is Carol from
        their Winterland show, Touch Me from the L.A.Forum? What
        turned out to be the long-awaited, long delayed, much
        celebrated famous Box Set? A disappointment for the
        long-time fan. Just 6 new unknown songs of 47 on the box!
        One live concert, mislabelled and cut, not even taken
        from one single concert but from at least 6 different
        shows. One totally uninteresting CD of band's favorites.
        Whole lotta material from bootlegs we already had in our
        collections for ages (on this box not even in better
        soundquality). Let me give you my comments on the tracks
        - I am giving you some extra information which was not
        given by The Doors in the accompanying book for the Box
        Set (The Doors' liner notes are pretty interesting and
        amusing to read, all comments are very characteristic for
        each member of the band, but there's a lot more you could
        say about the tracks): </strong></font><table border="0"

                For the Box Set it was taken from Jim Morrison's

                from another copy of the ony 5 existing ones. All
                songs from the first demo-recording have been
                perfectly restored and digitally remastered for
                the Box Set. Fine work, recorded without Robby,

                Center Coliseum, Seattle, June 5, 1970, published

                cuts was Paul Rothchild in 1979. Ray didn't play
                his organ or his piano but a mellotron on this
                tune. Just a few overdubs were done on the Adagio
                in 1997 - Robby added some guitar playing a pick
                (he never did that in the old days), and John

                published on the Missing Links bootleg CD and on

                January 24, 1969). So, in my opinion, the CD has
                got a misleading title. It has been cut from at
                least 6 different shows (four at the Felt Forum

                studio version from the first album. Jim's voice

                difference of moods - and to my great surprise -
                for the first time I am uncertain to decide which
                version I like more and prefer. The one on the
                Box Set is crystal clear, polished, combined with
                great music (especially Robby's guitar. I love to
                listen to it following Jim's piano chords) for

                bootleg is more direct, more intense but
                unpolished (for the Jim Morrison fan). If one
                can't decide, why not listen to the third
                version, recorded in Paris two weeks before he
                died, being totally drunk (as presented on Jim
                Morrison - The Lost Paris Tapes)? Strange lyrics,

                the song and his mates completed it for him; and
                that's exactly what we did with Jim&quot;, Ray
                Manzarek told Mojo Magazine last December. Why is
                this song credited &quot;Written by The

                and Tom Robbins and most insightful insider
                stories. Great to see photos of some master
                reel-to-reel boxes on the inlays (hey, what's the
                tune called PUSH-PUSH on the box labelled
                &quot;Doors Spares&quot;?) Are you guys saving
                this for a kind of Box Set Vol.2?<br>
                But I am sure - if they had only asked the fans,
                this Box Set would have been very different. This
                is definitely not the one that we expected. This
                is definitely not the GREAT LOST DOORS ALBUM that
                we have been awaiting for years. This came out
                because of public demand, or because box sets
                have become fashion. Thanks it is not another
                compilation album. This was released to top and
                beat the bootleggers. In my opinion, the Box Set
                fails compared to the rare material published on
                bootlegs for the past 25 years (despite just 6
                great new songs and versions). Pity. Being a
                collector of Doors music for 30 years, I am quite
                disappointed about the Box Set.<br>
                So are many fans and journalists who reviewed the
                4 CDs. Disappointed in a way to say this could
                have been done much much better. Much more
                satisfying for everybody. Everybody can't wait
                for a Volume 2, but be sure to carefully think
                over what the fans would like to hear. Even if it
                was the worst Morrison vocal ever, we would be
                happy to listen to it. As long as it is new to
                our ears. And - don't cut it! There's nothing
                better than the real, uncut Doors. But they're
                not on this Box Set. Pity.</strong></font></td>
