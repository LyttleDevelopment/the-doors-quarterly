        <p><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Before my interview with Ray
        Manzarek during my third stay in Los Angeles, his
        manager, Danny Sugerman, informed me while having
        breakfast at Duke's, that Ray had cancelled all future
        interviews, as he had got so sick and tired of all the
        hype to do with Oliver Stone's Doors film, and also
        because the press had ridiculed him after his withdrawal
        from the shooting of the film. In other words: Ray was in
        a huff. Evil tongues were rumoring that him and Danny had
        been compulsorily removed from the set, as apparently
        there had been a quarrel between Oliver Stone and Ray,
        because he had not seen his ideas realized in the film.
        When I phoned Ray after this to arrange a date, I got a
        different impression. Ray jovially asked me whether I
        could please make arrangements to have his date of birth
        rectified in a newly published Rock Encyclopaedia. He
        invited me to his house, so that we were </b><b><i>&quot;left
        in peace and have time for the interview&quot;</i></b><b>.
        Punctually at 3.00 p.m. I arrived at his English country
        style mansion situated near the exclusive Rodeo Drive.
        &quot;</b><b><i>Hello, how are you? Nice to see you&quot;</i></b><b>,
        he said. </b><b><i>&quot;Drive your car up in front of
        the garage, otherwise you'll get a ticket!&quot;</i></b><b>
        After I had parked my &quot;rental&quot; behind the small
        Japanese car standing in front of the garage, Ray waved
        me into his house. </b><b><i>&quot;May I introduce you to
        my wife, Dorothy? I'm afraid she is a little disabled at
        the moment ...&quot;</i></b><b> Dorothy was sitting on a
        large sofa in the lounge, which was not only decorated
        with large-sized modern avant-garde paintings by obscure
        modern painters, but also with a surprisingly small music
        system, connected to the television. Ray's wife, who is
        of Japanese descent, had her leg covered in Plaster of
        Paris resting comfortably on a glass table.</b> </font></p>

        said. </b><b><i>&quot;You were sitting on one of the
        graves with Pablo, am I right?&quot;</i></b><b> Dorothy
        nodded and said that she had then rather preferred to go
        shopping with Pablo, instead of being part of the chaos
        on July 3, 1981. In the meantime, Ray had served me a can
        of cold ginger drink. I placed my tape recorder on the

                finished writing my screen-play to &quot;L.A.
                Woman&quot;, a contemporary erotic, psychological
                thriller about a woman in Los Angeles and her
                battle with the forces of darkness, and an
                attempt to regain the light and the two guides
                who represent good and evil, and her relationship
                between these two men. And I just finished that a
                couple of weeks ago and a demo-soundtrack for it.
                We'll be doing one or two Doors songs. The title
                character is a performance artist, singer and
                poet, and she sings a Doors song, she sings
                &quot;Strange Days&quot; in the movie and
                &quot;Love Street&quot; along with some original
                compositions, too. And so hopefully within the
                next six months we can, you know, get ... I need
                three million dollars to make a low-budget,
                intellectual, artistic, exciting, erotic movie
                with a great soundtrack. If all goes well,
                hopefully in a year, year and a half, &quot;L.A.
                Woman&quot; will be reality. </b></font></td>

                telephone rings in the background and I put off
                the tape for a while. Ray talks with a
                photographer, who is doing some new promo photos,
                for a few minutes. In the meantime I realized
                that Ray did not at all appear &quot;to be in a
                huff&quot;, but to the contrary was answering my
                questions with his well-known enthusiasm and his
                distinctive facial expressions. I have often had
                the opportunity to talk to Ray before, and it
                again became clear to me why he used to be
                described as the spokesman for The Doors and why
                the fans liked to listen to him. Ray Manzarek
                talks in a lively fashion and underlines his
                words with an abundance of gestures. His sonorous
                voice makes him believable. Once he starts going
                during a conversation there is no way to stop
                him. A very pleasant interview partner. Dorothy
                seems like his shadow, hardly ever leaves his
                side and appears to be Ray's silent support.
                During the conversation they exchange hardly
                noticeable glances, as if Ray loved to be
                reassured by her. Although Dorothy must have
                heard some of the answers and stories countless
                times, she was showing obvious interest in our
                conversation. After the telephone call I pressed
                my recorder button again and we continued our
                interview.)</i></b><b> </b></font></td>

                McClure and myself opening for Alan Ginsberg, so
                it was a night of poetry and music that was just

                is that Alan Ginsberg is ... but this character
                is always dashing about. Alan Ginsberg is still
                dashing about. He's 65 years old and he's just
                loaded with energy and charm and wit and, you
                know, his mind is constantly racing and
                invariably you have to take him by the arm and
                say &quot;C'mon man, it's late, we've gotta get
                on the plane,&quot; you know, he says, &quot;All
                right, of course,&quot; and he dashes off towards
                the plane and then you find yourself running
                after him, and he's 65 years old. It's amazing.
                And reading on stage he was great, so we had
                three just absolutely incredible ... it was, it
                was like being a beatnik, it was like, you know,
                it was like 1960/58/60/62. It was absolutely
                amazing. The audiences were just charged with
                emotion, they were great for Michael and me, and
                then for Alan. They were just over the top, just
                screaming, just shouting, and ... it's rare to
                see a poetry-reading with all that intensity
                coming back from the audience. It was great. </b></font></td>

                had the Eisbein, of course, and the roast goose

                to, you know, to do a little rearrangement to
                make it a little bit shorter because the piece as

                twenty minutes a side, and at the time - '83/'84
                - CDs weren't that big yet. On a CD I could have
                done the whole piece easily, but on a black disc
                to make 40 minutes I had to do a little
                rearranging and compression and eliminate a
                couple of pieces, but that was a lot of fun. It

                opposite, very stimulating, and he had a great
                keyboard-player with him, Michael Riesman, who
                did a lot of the synthesizer parts; we'd work on
                the things together. So Michael brought in the
                orchestral score and we would go through the
                orchestral score with an emulator and decide on
                which part we wanted to use or which parts we
                didn't need. 'Cause we had the drums, and the
                guitar, and the bass and everything going so you
                didn't need to add a lot of timpani or things
                'cos the drums were covered. So, that was a lot
                of fun, and all the singers were people that had
                originally sung &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;.
                That's where Philip was instrumental in getting
                people from the New York ... from the New York
                opera, and, you know, classical singers who had
                sung the piece before. And when they came into
                the studio they had no idea what to expect, they
                knew that they were gonna be doing &quot;Carmina
                Burana&quot;, but they didn't know that it was
                going to be a whole contemporary version. And
                when they heard the music, when they heard, you
                know, the drums and everything and ... they had a
                grand time. It was really fun to watch those
                people sing. Okay, &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;,
                you know, to classical people &quot;Carmina
                Burana&quot; is an old chestnut, okay, we know
                that piece, yeah, my God, they're gonna do it
                again, not again. But when they heard the drums
                and the piano and the bass and everything just
                really chugging, they were marvelous, they just
                rose to the occasion, you could see the men out
                there speak, they became the monks, you know, it
                was great to watch them. And at the end of the
                session they said &quot;This was so much fun,
                we've never had so much fun in a recording
                studio.&quot; Well... it's Rock'n'Roll, man. </b><b><i>(laughs)</i></b><b>

                of 2000 years of
                Judea-Christian-Greco-Roman-Western civilization
                to become a free man on the planet, not beholden
                to any one form of thought, but worshipping at
                the altar of freedom. And that's what it's about.
