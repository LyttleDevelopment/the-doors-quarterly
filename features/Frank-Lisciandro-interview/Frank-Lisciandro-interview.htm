</i></b></font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>RAINER</b>:
Frank, I think you were one of Jim Morrison's closest friends. I
guess you were also one of the<br>
last one who saw him at the airport in Los Angeles when he left
America for Paris.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, I remember Babe brought him to the airport
but Kathy and I met him there. They went in<br>
their car and we went in another car, and we met at L.A.
International Airport the night that Jim was<br>
supposed to be leaving for Paris. It was in early March 1971. We
sat in the bar, at a table, talking about<br>
a lot of different things - what he planned to do there, that we
all planned to visit him there, how long he<br>
planned to be there, like that. You know, it's been a long time
since 1971 and it's hard to remember exact<br>
conversations. But what strikes me about that evening - it was a
typical evening with Jim. We had become<br>
so animated with conversation, and so involved in our
conversation that we missed the three announcements<br>
for the airplane, and in fact Jim missed his plane, he never got
on the plane that night and he had to go back<br>
to the airport the following morning and get on the plane, so
that's when he left for Paris.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What did he look like? Did he look healthy? Did he
still have his beard?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: He had a beard, he was wearing whatever he was
wearing because Jim didn't think to change to<br>
do anything, you know what I mean, some people say, well, I'm
going to the theatre, I think I'll change,<br>
I'm going to a museum, I think I'll put on my museum clothes ...
Jim did wear the same clothes all the time<br>
he was comfortable with himself and comfortable with his clothes.
So whatever he was wearing that day -<br>
I'm sure he was wearing it the following day also. So he kept the
same clothes, he had a beard, he was<br>
in very good health, as I remember because just a week or two
before we had played an entire day of<br>
American football, touch football. There are some pictures
showing that in a couple of books that I've<br>
done. Kathy took the pictures, though. And - as I remember - we
played with some young college guys<br>
who were supposed to be in good shape. Jim played all day with
them, with us, and he survived that ordeal<br>
of very long vigorous playing very well. And so he was in very
good, excellent physical shape when he went.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Did he tell you about any plans how long he was
gonna stay in Paris? And what exactly was<br>
the reason he left Los Angeles?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Jim's feeling at the time - and I remember this
distinctly because we had more than one<br>
conversation about it - was that his days in Los Angeles were
over for this particular part of his life.<br>
He had finished the commitment to Elektra Records and had
finished the last album they owed them<br>
on the contract. And he had somewhat put behind him the Miami
trial although there might be an appeal<br>
or whatever that was behind him. Pamela was waiting for him in
Paris and had established a home there.<br>
My feeling and the feeling of the people who knew him closely was
that he was leaving. As a matter of<br>
fact we had closed the <i>HWY</i> Production office because Jim
said it wasn't necessary that wherever he<br>
would be there would be a production office if we gonna do a film
in the future, continue <i>HWY</i> or whatever.<br>
And so with the closing of the <i>HWY</i> office, with Jim's
finishing the commitment to Elektra Records it was<br>
over for Jim in Los Angeles. He was leaving for good. For as long
as he could get away from L.A. And his<br>
subsequent communications with people here, for instance Bob
Greene or myself, indicated the same<br>
thing: He was through with this particular part of his career and
his life and he was embarked on something<br>
new. I don't think there's any doubt in my mind or the people
that knew him very well, but this was true.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: You told me you got a letter from Jim from Paris.
What was this letter about? Especially - did<br>
he tell you anything about his feelings, about the mood he
experienced being in Paris, you know, being<br>
in the city of poets and artists?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I had written to Jim about a month after he left
saying that Kathy and I were planning a trip to Paris.<br>
In fact we were going to make a long motordrive through Eastern
Europe and we would be stopping in<br>
Paris to pick up a car. In my letter I invited Pamela and Jim to
come along with us on any particular part of<br>
this drive. We were going to see a friend of us in Hungary and we
were going to be going to Greece and<br>
Turkey and it would be nice if they would like to come along with
us. I got a letter back from Jim about<br>
maybe three weeks later saying that he had recently before been
in Corsica, where he had in a typical<br>
Jim Morrison fashion lost his wallet and his passport, but then
he was back in Paris, and he invited Kathy<br>
and me to stay with them at their apartment in Paris while we
were there. He didn't mention about the trip<br>
whether or not he intended or wanted to think about going on a
part of our trip. And he didn't say much<br>
about Paris. As I remember he talked about their trip to Corsica,
he also said that he was doing well and<br>
that it would be good to see old friends again after all this
time. My feeling now is that Jim was somewhat<br>
lonely for his friends in Paris and that he was lonely for
communications and conversations because he<br>
didn't speak any French. Now he had gone to live in a place where
I suspect he might have assumed<br>
that there would be more English spoken than there was. But in
Paris in 1971 there were not a lot of<br>
people who spoke English. Back then, there were precious few that
really spoke English and you would<br>
have a conversation with. Now, of course, half Parisians you meet
speak English. I think Jim was lonely<br>
for conversations in English. He was lonely because he loved
talking, he loved listening to people, he<br>
loved asking questions. I think this was one of the drawbacks of
his being in Paris, this sense of isolation<br>
because of the language. He was one with no language ability at
all - none! And Pamela had none, either.<br>
I think that must have been a terrible experience. I've just
experienced that myself having lived in Russia<br>
for months and not having language ability there, and how
isolating that could be. I think that the tone of<br>
the letter definitely is very inviting, very anxious to see old
friends again, to pick up conversations that had<br>
left off. I haven't really looked at the letter for some time;
stored it away safely.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Did he write you anything about the poems he was
writing in Paris?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: No, I don't remember him writing about poetry. I do
remember a letter that he wrote to Bob<br>
Greene asking in a typical Jim Morrison fashion - not having the
slightest idea how much money he had<br>
or how much money might be coming in to his account - how long he
- Bob Greene, their financial<br>
manager - thought that Jim and Pam could live in Paris, a week, a
month, a year. Jim had no idea about<br>
these sorts of things, he just wasn't interested really but he
was asking that his financial manager: could<br>
they live there for a continuing period of time, because Jim
wasn't - or he thought he wasn't - earning a<br>
living. Of course, records were selling and he was earning
royalties all the time. And so it seemed to me<br>
that even though there was this isolation about language he was
intending to stay there, or why would he<br>
ask this question about how long he could possibly stay? And in
that letter to Bob Greene he does say<br>
how beautiful Paris is, how wonderful it is, I remember that part
of the letter. I don't remember Jim writing<br>
about poetry, but you know, Jim never spoke about his poetry,
either, never really told people. Perhaps<br>
he spoke with Michael McClure 'cos Michael has told me that he
and Jim talked about poetry, but I don't<br>
remember Jim saying very much about his poetry other than when
his books were published.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Then, all of the sudden, the news came that Jim
had died. How did you learn about his death,<br>
how did you feel then, especially as you were about going to
Paris to see him there?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: It was July 4th that we heard the news. Babe Hill,
probably Jim's closest friend, was at our<br>
apartment, and we were intending to have a meal on this big
American celebration day and go out together.<br>
Then came the call from Bill Siddons who told us the news. He
talked to Babe, he talked to me, then to<br>
Kathy. He told each of us. I was shocked beyond comprehension.
Sometimes you don't internalize news<br>
very quickly, you have the information but not the body reactions
to the information. The emotional and<br>
spiritual reaction to the information.That just developed after a
period of time. I was just shocked, speechless<br>
about it. It was like having the rug pulled off under your feet.
But, you know, we were intending to go to Europe<br>
to visit Jim in Paris. We had given up our apartment, hadn't
moved out yet but the lease was going to be<br>
terminated. We had begun to put out things in storage, we had our
airline tickets and our reservation for<br>
renting a car. We were going to go. There was no turning back. I
had finished some work on a film that I was<br>
doing, Kathy had finished her work at the Doors' office where she
was working. And in fact we were in L.A.<br>
for another week. We would spend virtually that entire week at
The Doors' office answering phone calls, writing<br>
letters to people, trying to console absolute strangers and
friends of Jim's who would call daily. Dozens and<br>
dozens of calls came into that office, expressing grief and
horror at Jim's death, and we who were very close<br>
to him had to play the role of consoling all these other people.
But after a week we got on the plane and flew to<br>
Paris. Within a day we visited the cemetery Père Lachaise and I
came to grips with the fact that I wouldn't<br>
see Jim anymore, although it's hard to put a person to rest when
you don't see their dead body. That was a<br>
very emotional and moving visit to the grave. We stayed there for
some time and then we went on with our trip<br>
through Europe visiting people that knew Jim. Of course we had to
share that news with them as we visited them.<br>
It wasn't easy for anyone, really. He touched people's lives -
even the people he knew only for a day or two - in<br>
such a deep and meaningful way because Jim was interested in
people, interested to the point where he could<br>
have a conversation with you of a half hour duration and you
thought, my goodness, this man is my best friend<br>
because he would just respond to you as a person and somehow you
would tell him about yourself in such a<br>
unique and open intimate way that you felt in some way that he
was making a real contact. And he was really<br>
very interested in everyone. So a lot of people were touched by
him and of course his death was a big gap in<br>
people's lives. And for years I had continuing dreams and
remembrances of Jim, sometimes of the most<br>
startling real variety.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>(During the last few minutes of this part of the interview
&#150; taped in a beautiful park in Santa Barbara - a<br>
dog kept howling in the background)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</i>I should say something about the dog, actually. There's a dog
near us where we are taping this interview<br>
that is in a yard and not free. And Jim wrote a poem about a dog,
a very beautiful poem, but there's a song I<br>
remember that Bob Dylan wrote called <i>Dogs Run Free</i>, and
it's been running through my mind because the<br>
day I first heard that song I was riding with Jim in a car in Los
Angeles and the song came on the radio.<br>
Jim was quite taken with the poetry in the song Dogs Run Free,
and it reminded me of this dog, because<br>
Jim was interested in freedom most of all, personal freedom not
only of physical variety which we are all<br>
somewhat interested in, but he was also interested in the freedom
of the other variety, an artistic and spiritual<br>
freedom in which people aren't pre-programmed from youth to
remember or think about things in a certain way.<br>
It is appropriate that this dog who is here tied up should be
reminding us of Jim's other fascination and<br>
dedication and motivation towards freedom all the time, both in
his personal life and in his art. And I think if<br>
anything he said it best, people have asked him all the time what
did his poetry mean, what was his life about,<br>
and he kept saying the same thing:<i> 'I'm interested in
freedom.'</i> So perhaps that's the best thing that we can<br>
come away with the one thing - we should come away with this
sense that I think he went to Paris for freedom.<br>
I think that L.A. had become a prison and a trap for him, and he
escaped to Paris to get out of that prison and<br>
that trap because it was just like being in that courtroom in
Miami where the thought of being in a jail somewhere<br>
in Dade County, Florida, that that Los Angeles was no more a free
and open expression place for him.<br>
It was a place that was confining because of all the obligations,
the expectations, all the social norms of American<br>
culture. And he actually felt that he needed to break away, break
out, break on through if you will, to Paris.<br>

<br>
</font><font color="#FFFFFF" size="4" face="Arial"><b>RAINER</b>:
Do you remember your first impression of Jim?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: My first impression of him at the UCLA &#150; he
was quiet, somehow hidden and soft-spoken. Jim almost<br>
disappeared in the presence of Ray Manzarek or Bill Curby, who
used to be a Hollywood screen writer.<br>
I remember I went to the UCLA library one day and believe it or
not, Jim had a job at the library stacking books.<br>
I was wandering around in the library looking for books to read
and I came across him. He was sitting in the<br>
back of the library on the floor with a bunch of books next to
him. He wasn&#146;t sorting these books and putting<br>
them back on the shelves &#150; he was reading them! And I said, <i>&#147;No
wonder we can&#146;t find any books in here!&#148;</i><br>
Well, that&#146;s the kind of guy he was. He was behind the
scenes at UCLA a lot. I also remember him the first time<br>
he was on stage at the London Fog &#150; he kept his back to the
audience, whispering and croaking into that<br>
microphone. I left the London Fog shaking my head saying, <i>&#147;That
guy will never be a singer!&#148;</i> He really wasn&#146;t<br>
that Jim Morrison we know from the film clips and stuff. It took
a while to really develop the Jim Morrison we<br>
know now. He was very shy, not much to go out there and be an
extravert. When I came back I saw them at<br>
the Shrine Auditorium, I think it was in December of 1967, and he
was magnificent, he was in full command of<br>
the audience, of himself and his power on stage. He had
transformed himself into a performer. He had<br>
discovered the power of transforming himself into what he wanted
to be by the force of his own personality.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Let's talk about <i>HWY</i>, the film you made
with Jim. When did you start filming?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: It was during the Easter break, the Easter holiday.
I think it was the Wednesday or Thursday<br>
before Easter in 1969 we went to Palm Springs in order to film
for <i>HWY.<br>
<br>
<br>
</i><b>RAINER</b>: Where did Jim get the story from? Did he make
it up or...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I believe so.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: There was a story of a mass murderer searching for
victims at that time, early 1969.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Right, there were always stories of mass murderers
around, you know. The Manson thing had<br>
happened before that, but Jim had this idea a very long time
before. You can trace it back in his poetry,<br>
this idea of the cycle of life that a mass murderer comes back
each time through the process of rebirth.<br>
And this is a continuing kind of idea that Jim had. It wasn't
something that was born just because of stories<br>
of mass murderers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I remember one scene showing a coyote lying down
on the road. Did you just come across<br>
that accident or ...?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: We came across this scene as we probably came
across everything that was going to be filmed.<br>
It was a spontaneous filming. We went with a script to film but
in fact it became a spontaneous film. We<br>
walked or acted in the scenes as they were happening, as we came
across them and so although there<br>
was a script for <i>HWY</i> it became more an exercise in
capturing the moment. So it is not only a fictional film<br>
but also a documentary. Of this total film I would say more than
half of it is just occurrences that happened<br>
to us. Scenes that we came across, scenes that were significant,
scenes that we wanted to put on film.<br>
So the way it was scripted it was also not scripted at the same
time. There was this dynamic proportion to it<br>
where there were scripted proportions and not scripted
proportions acting together.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What in the script was realized in the final film?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, there was a lot more in the script. You can
read the script in <i>American Night</i>. Perhaps just<br>
a very small part, less than five percent was realized on film,
and that was because it was an attempt to<br>
interest one of the studios in a continuing project, because the
film cost a lot of money and Jim didn't want to<br>
spend all of his own money. In fact he spent a lot of his own
money but he thought a studio would be<br>
interested in completing the film. Like in Paris - he wanted to
do the same thing: he wanted to find a<br>
company to complete <i>HWY</i>, to continue it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Continue? How?<br>
<br>

<b>FRANK</b>: Continue the filming so that the whole script could
be realized. The script was called<br>
<i>An American Pastoral.<br>

</i><b>RAINER</b>: But he looked quite different in Paris, no
beard and so on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, there could be scenes written when this
person who comes out of the mountains loses<br>
his beard. In fact there was talk about filming such a scene, and
Jim had a very abounded beard; it could<br>
have grown back in a weekend.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What about the music in <i>HWY</i>? I know it was
Paul Ferrara's wife Georgia singing - was this<br>
recorded before or after the filming?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I remember it was recorded during the editing or
just before the editing. Somewhere in the<br>
editing process of <i>HWY</i>, which took a little bit of time,
that mountain song was recorded but they had written<br>
the song before. Then Paul Ferrara brought it to Jim to listen to
it and Jim thought it would be perfect with the<br>
film, so then it was recorded. Paul and Georgia recorded that one
but I don't remember how they recorded it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Who wrote that song?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: They did. It's their song. They wrote the music and
the words and recorded it together. She<br>
sang and he played the guitar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: During the scenes driving through L.A. there's
always some radio sound with them, somebody<br>
switching the radio on and off, like that. Was that Jim's work?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I did all of that. I created all the sound effects,
all the incidental music, and then Fred Myrow<br>
took it and played music during the film. So here's the
combination effect of the soundtrack: Fred<br>
Myrow's playing and material that I collected from ethnic records
or sound effect records. There also<br>
was some material that Babe Hill recorded.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Where did you film the scenes of Jim standing in a
supermarket checking books?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: That was somewhere in the Californian desert. I
don't exactly remember the name of the town<br>
but it was coming back from filming and we stopped to get some
gas. We went in to film this. Jim liked<br>
the sense of America that the books and the magazines represented
and he wanted the hitchhiker to<br>
be filmed in there if looking through a kind of a review of
America, kind of pop literary form, you know,<br>
magazines and these few paperbacks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Jim once said about <i>HWY</i> it was a movie of a
hitchhiker coming down from the mountains into<br>
a big city. During the trip he killed somebody, but - I mean, you
cannot see anybody being killed, you know,<br>
he gets into the car, somebody else is driving, and all of the
sudden Jim is at the wheel driving. Speaking<br>
in cinematic terms it is not a good way to create suspense as
Hitchcock would say. In fact most people<br>
wouldn't even notice anything of this 'killer on the road'-story.
Without any knowledge of what Jim wanted<br>
to create around that theme, I think people would hardly notice
that the driver had changed or any storyline.<br>
It is tough to follow that movie from that scene on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, I think this film was filmed like a poem in a
sense that it demands active participation by the<br>
viewer, not passive participation. So, if you don't notice that
the driver is not Jim and don't wonder what<br>
happened to the other driver ... Well, I mean, obviously the
other driver didn't say, <i>&quot;Hey, I like you, here's my<br>
Chevy 500!&quot;</i> Apparently this hitchhiker stole the car, or
somehow got the car, and if you people don't notice<br>
that as the viewers, you didn't pay attention. Then you're a part
of the television generation, which accepts<br>
whatever they see without thinking about it. And in this movie
there are many many examples of those kinds<br>
of things. It is an experience of discovery that people make, it
is not something that is handed to you. It is<br>
something that you must create while viewing it. Jim's poetry is
the same way. So I find a consistency in<br>
<i>HWY</i> with Jim's poetry in a way that the viewer or the
reader participates in the creation. Jim was correct in<br>
saying that his art is to make people look inside themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What about the scenes inside and outside a bar
towards the end of the film?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, the outside of the bar was the Whisky, but
just the outside scene, and then we actually<br>
went to another bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: The Extension?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: No, I don't think so. I honestly don't remember.
But it was down there on the Strip. We went<br>
to another place because they wouldn't let us film in the Whisky.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Everyone seemed to know Jim in there, right?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Yapp, yayaya <i>(laughs).</i> Of course.<br>

<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I guess it was Jim's idea to climb up the 9000
Building on Sunset. It looks pretty dangerous<br>
what he was doing there on the roof.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I was totally against it. I didn't think it was
worth the risk. And everyone was against it. We<br>
wanted to tie a rope around him but he was insisting on doing it
this way. We were horrified. Once he<br>
climbed up onto the ledge there was nothing we could do. But if
we tried to do anything at that point we<br>
might have caused an accident. So the only thing we could do was
to film him as he was on the ledge.<br>
And of course there were no lights to film. It was ridiculous. It
was no set-up-scene, as I've said, many<br>
things happened spontaneously and we just didn't have any lights
with us. We were supposed to film<br>
these shots of the city from the top of the 9000 Building, not
from Jim walking on the ledge. If we had<br>
known that that was gonna happen we might have brought safety
ropes and all kinds of things. But it<br>
was a spontaneous moment that Jim decided to do and he did it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: The end of the movie seems pretty strange to me, I
mean there seems to be no end at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: The movie was put together in the exact way it was
filmed. In the exact order of scenes.<br>
And that was how Jim wanted to do it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Could we call <i>HWY</i> an unfinished movie?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I would call it a work in progress. The
continuation was intended, perhaps, but at the same<br>
time he thought it was complete. I would be dishonest to tell you
something else. So when the poet<br>
says his poem was complete, or the film maker says his film was
complete, one accepts that that's<br>
what he wanted to do. And he said<i>, &quot;I've done enough,
this is what I wanted to do. Let's put it<br>
together the way it is.&quot;</i> I think it's a film. And for
him it was a film.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Ray Manzarek once told me in an interview that
this film was made under the influence of<br>
cannabinol and other strange substances...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Ray didn't participate in that film and Jim didn't
want the other band members as participants,<br>
so I don't think he has the right to talk about how it was made,
why it was made, what it is about;<br>
simply because he doesn't know. He was not any part of it...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Well, we just talked about the film...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: The Doors asked to be part of it when the filming
was being done but Jim said, <i>&quot;No, this is<br>
my film, and it is not a Doors film!&quot;</i> And he refused to
have them in there, he refused to accept any<br>
of their money, and he refused any of their participation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I know The Doors would love to get their hands on
the first 10 minutes of <i>HWY </i>to use it<br>
in a video...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: My answer to that is very simple. Jim's wishes were
that The Doors were not involved. This<br>
product, as it was completed by Jim, as it was shown in Paris on
December 4th, 1993, is what Jim<br>
wanted as a film. It is exactly how Jim created it. To cut it up
is to do damage to Jim's creative art.<br>
It's the same as cutting up his poems and mixing them together as
they did for instance in Oliver Stone's<br>
movie: They cut up the poems and mixed them together. It would be
a tragedy to do that to Jim's work of<br>
art, just as it'll be to take three or four of Picasso's
paintings, cut them up and make a collage of it. So I<br>
have a strong feeling that this should never be done, and I'll
oppose it if they'll ever attempt to use it in<br>
silly videoclips.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: But you were involved in the making of the record <i>An
American Prayer</i>. There were countless<br>
cuts in his poems, countless pieces of poetry put together. The
poems were not represented in the<br>
form Jim had recorded them on tape...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: That was not my doing, and I'm ashamed of that. I'm
sorry about that and I apologize to people.<br>
I hope that in some way it could be restored. I could have quit
the project at that point but it was the way<br>
it was gonna be. And I agree - I think that was wrong. I
attempted in the two poetry books to present the<br>
entire <i>An American Prayer</i>, even the sections people didn't
know about, 'cos Jim wrote and recorded<br>
much more than came later out on record...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: That's interesting, but it wasn't the answer to my
question about strange substances. So, were<br>
there any drugs involved in the creative process of making this
movie?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I wouldn't be honest to tell you that there weren't
any drugs somewhere. There were all kinds<br>
of drugs in the Sixties. But <i>HWY</i> is not a drug film, it is
not about drugs. Drugs weren't being used for<br>
the creative part of it. This is a film that Jim made as a
cinematic artist.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: When it was shown in Paris during the celebration
party for his 50th birthday party everybody<br>
walked out of the cinema quietly, stunned, not able to say
anything about what they've just seen...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Perhaps the effect was, you know, well, it actually
played in the middle of three films. So I<br>
guess the people walking out of the theatre were having a lot of
different ideas, because they saw<br>
three films, <i>Feast Of Friends, HWY</i>, and then <i>The Doors
Are Open</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Probably too many films...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Too many and much too late. It started 12.40 at
night so that people actually had no reign<br>
about. That's understandable, especially they've been running
around Paris, they've been trying to<br>
get into the cinema, and many of them had not been able to get
in. But I think that the effect of the<br>
film was to leave one speechless. To me it's a profound statement
of art when the artform leaves<br>
one speechless. You have no judgement, you have no sense of what
it's all about, just eternalize it.<br>
And I think what Jim said about his poetry was true, <i>&quot;If
my poetry seeks to do anything it seeks to<br>
open people's minds.&quot;</i> This doesn't necessarily mean that
you're giving a conclusion or giving them<br>
an answer. You just open their minds to something that was inside
their brains, and then they come<br>
to an answer themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: An American Prayer out on CD in perfect sound -
what do you think?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Wonderful! It should be done without any music.
Just the way Jim recorded it. With all the<br>
sections, not just the first section, not just the ending with <i>'Feast
Of Friends To The Giant Family</i>'.<br>
Not just ending at that line but also the second part of the poem
which he recorded. And this ought to be<br>
put out as an entire poem.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: For the album you used some of the poetry he
recorded December 8, 1970, but he also did<br>
another recording session prior to that...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Yes, there were two recording sessions and we used
both for the record.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Do you remember when the first one took place?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: It was approximately 18 months before the December
8 session; I don't know the exact<br>
date, probably spring 1969, when he recorded one tape, about half
an hour long with poetry with<br>
John Haeny. It took place at Elektra Studios on La Cienega
Boulevard. And that's the recording<br>
session everybody has on bootleg. As far as I know Elektra
rejected the idea that Jim should put<br>
out an album by himself of poetry. They decided not to do it. I
don&#146;t know what he told them or<br>
what proposal he had or anything like that, but they rejected it.
But they gave him the money, they<br>
put up the money to record that half hour.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Why did he do just two professionally recorded
poetry sessions?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I don't know. It was strange. He was in a recording
studio all the time and he only had two<br>
opportunities to actually record poetry.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: You were present at the second session, what do
you remember?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, it was his 27th birthday. He went into the
studio that night, bought the studio time, invited<br>
a few friends, throwing a party for himself and recorded poetry.
Kathy was there, Florentine was there,<br>
I was there taking pictures, and that poetry was kept safe by
John Haeny who was the engineer at both<br>
sessions and who was a record producer and recording engineer in
Los Angeles for a long time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Then, years later, Robby remembered the tapes, as
far as the myth goes...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Yes, eventually The Doors got together with Haeny
and invited me along, and we put together<br>
Jim's poetry. Put it together in a fashion that I think is
playable to the public, although it might not have<br>
been exactly what Jim was intending to do. I think he wanted to
publish the poetry without any Rock'n'Roll,<br>
definitely without The Doors. He wanted this to be separate from
his career as a member of The Doors.<br>
But The Doors were involved and they put music, shape music
around this poetry, and I think it plays pretty<br>
well. The songs that are in the booklet are not from the records
but from Jim&#146;s notebooks. We went back<br>
to the source of what was written in the notebooks. Just see the
differences between the songs on the<br>
albums and what&#146;s in the booklet. That was the most original
source. They were books of writing, not of<br>
singing. It's been a well received album, nominated for a Grammy
in this country as a spoken word album.<br>
Amazingly enough it is listened to all over the world. The sales
of the album seem to continue not only in<br>
English speaking countries but all over the planet. There's a
power and majesty in Jim's voice that is<br>
astounding to me. I'd love to be able to let people hear all the
tapes without the music, just Jim reading the<br>
poems. I think there's a music in that by itself, music in the
words and music in the sound of his voice that<br>
is really compelling.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I remember that hotel in Hamburg where we both
first met in 1978 along with the three Doors, you<br>
guys were on your promotional tour for <i>An American Prayer</i>.
We all sat in a certain room doing an interview<br>
for German radio, and all of the sudden there was the wind
howling through a window, and I remember it<br>
was you telling the story how this little bird came into the
studio during your work on <i>An American Prayer</i>.<br>
And Ray said, <i>&#147;Hi Jim!&#148;<br>

</i><b>FRANK</b>: Well, I think that&#146;s there, because Jim
made such a mark on our lives, and he continues to do so.<br>
And this phenomena of Jim in Europe now with all these people
every year &#150; two and a half million people<br>
visit his grave every year I understand &#150; this phenomena is
greater than when Jim was alive. As a matter<br>
of fact, he&#146;s more dangerous than when he was alive because
they need two people to guard him constantly<br>
now at the grave, this phenomena is just an indication of what an
effect this man has had on people and<br>
continues to have through his words, through his music, through
his images, through his stories, through his<br>
philosophy; and we knew him personally, we were just very very
lucky to have had that opportunity, and<br>
although we might not have learned anything more about what he
was talking about than the people who<br>
came to know Jim after he was dead through his works, because
it&#146;s all there in the works, and you get that<br>
feeling through the work, through the songs, through the music,
through the poetry.<br>

<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Did he write the lyrics after the recording of the
songs or before, I mean, were these the<br>
transcripts of the lyrics to remember the songs?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Well, it happened both ways. Sometimes he would
spontaneously create the songs on stage<br>
and change them on stage, constantly revising them, changing and
revising them, and at some point<br>
someone would ask him to write it down for the songbooks that
kept coming out for each album, you<br>
know, with words and musical notes. So he would write lyrics
down. Those were the source of the books.<br>
There are songs in the book <i>The American Night</i> which they
never recorded. So he would just write the<br>
words for a song without caring about anything else. In The
American Night you will see that there&#146;s the<br>
entire <i>An American Prayer</i> poem. We did know &#150; in fact
Ray Manzarek didn&#146;t remember that &#150; we thought<br>
the poem was exactly as Jim published it in this small book <i>An
American Prayer</i>. We thought THAT was<br>
<i>An American Prayer</i>. But in fact it was longer than that.
He recorded everything that we wrote down in the<br>
book. All of that is recorded. We could have put all of that on
the album. But we didn&#146;t know that was all<br>
ONE poem. The reason that was cut out was because certain people
didn&#146;t like it. They had recorded the<br>
piece of music beforehand, the Adagio, which is the background
music for the<i> Prayer</i>. Who was the<br>
composer, I don&#146;t remember?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Tomaso Albinoni.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Right, that piece was recorded by The Doors a long
time ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I guess it was the same recording you used in <i>Feast
of Friends</i>?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Yes. That was a piece of music Jim really liked.
And when we were putting together<br>
<i>An American Prayer, </i>I thought maybe some cello piece would
be nice, and we already had the<br>
<i>Adagio</i> on tape. It was perfect, except that is was too
short. And I think that&#146;s the reason why<br>
phrases were cut out to make the poem fit to pre-recorded music.
We didn&#146;t have to record that<br>
again. But that was not a good excuse then, you should never cut
a poem. I was angry about it.<br>
Corky (Courson) was angry about it. I think it was Ray&#146;s
idea to do the cutting. But I don&#146;t<br>
remember exactly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: The <i>Air, Earth, Fire, Water</i> poem from <i>Feast
of Friends</i>, when and how was that recorded?<br>
His voice and the sound of the recording is very strange.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I&#146;ll tell you how we recorded that. We used a
portable Nagra tape recorder, you know,<br>
Swiss-made, which they used in the movie business. If you listen
to what you&#146;re recording, you hear exactly<br>
what is being said. In other words, you hear the sound from the
microphone. So there&#146;s a button you can<br>
push on it in which the sound will be delayed, so then the sound
comes off the tape. If you put on the<br>
earphones and you try to speak at the same time as something is
recorded and playing back in your ears,<br>
your voice begins to stumble because you can&#146;t process those
two pieces of information at the same time.<br>
So that&#146;s why at the end of the poem Jim is struggling to
say the words, because he can&#146;t do it. His brain is<br>
telling him, &#147;<i>You can&#146;t do this!&#148;</i> So it
again was a kind of creative experience to record a piece of
poetry to<br>
make it as difficult as possible for the artist; make it so
difficult that he almost sounds like he is struggling<br>
to say the words.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: How did Jim write his poetry? I mean he rarely
talked about his own lyrics and his poems.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: He was very reserved talking about himself,
especially about the things that were meaningful<br>
to him like his poems, like his writing poetry and like the craft
of poetry. Actually, I didn't discover he was so<br>
devoted to the craft until I started compiling these books of his
poems, which have come out in the last few<br>
years. Then, when I looked through the 26 or 28 notebooks and the
hundreds of pages of handwritten poems,<br>
did I realize that Jim would write a poem over and over again
until he got it right. They were not written over<br>
and over again in one sitting but it could be years apart. I'd
find a poem in one notebook that I knew was an<br>
early one and the same poem in a later notebook. Somehow he was
able to bring that poem from one<br>
notebook to another, changing it suddenly each time making it a
stronger poem with a stronger voice to it.<br>
I didn't realize he was a devoted follower of the craft of poetry
to that extend because he never spoke about it.<br>
He wasn't one to go out spouting his poems in the street as in
some Hollywood portrait of him was shown.<br>
Jim didn't do that. He was a very quiet sort of person. We only
had a few incidences where we actually<br>
experienced Jim reading his poetry other than the rock stage
where he sometimes extemporaneously would<br>
shout out or speak a poem. He did a couple of poetry readings,
though, but he was so shy and so humble<br>
about it that he just wouldn't lay that on us. I mean it was
enough that he was a rock star and had a reputation,<br>
but then to put on us the thing that he was a poet - I mean he
was very proud of being a poet but he just<br>
didn't push it on people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: In <i>No One Here Gets Out Alive</i> and other
books, they point out a lot of negative sides and<br>
negative stories about Jim Morrison, what is your honest opinion
on that?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: For me it is the whole subject of my quest in the
last couple of years working with Jim&#146;s poetry.<br>
I started this quest a long time ago when I made the book <i>An
Hour For Magic</i> and the propose of it was to<br>
say that this guy that is talked about in <i>Nothing Here But
Lots Of Lies</i> is not the guy that I knew. <i>Nothing<br>
Here But Lots Of Lies </i>is exactly what it is, it&#146;s a lot
of lies! I didn&#146;t know that person pictured in that book.<br>
The person I knew I tried to talk about in<i> An Hour For Magic. </i>And
after being exposed to his poetry for<br>
such a long time I know a lot more about him. And in some ways
it&#146;s almost too much to talk about, because<br>
he was such a complex person, and then talking to about 30 of his
closest friends, everybody says the same<br>
thing about Jim in different ways. Everyone says that he was
sensitive and intelligent, well-read without a doubt,<br>
that he was one of the smartest people they have ever met, that
he was creative, that he was generous, that he<br>
was reckless and a little bit mad in a reckless kind of way. He
didn&#146;t have any concern about his physical way<br>
of being, he didn&#146;t care about money, he didn&#146;t care
about fame. That he was actually like an alien in the<br>
American culture and that he was very striving to be himself,
trying to be himself. He didn&#146;t mind pain, not any<br>
of those things, and he would confront everybody. So I think in
some ways he was very unique, very different<br>
and very special as a person. Everyone I talked to has the same
kind of stories to tell about him. I asked every<br>
person the same questions, and one of the questions was, &#147;<i>Did
you ever see Jim being violent?</i>&#148; No one had<br>
a story where he broke a chair or damaged some furniture. Never
did he hit anybody else. Never he did start<br>
a fight in a bar. There are these stories about bar fights &#150;
never! Not one! Not one of the people I met even<br>
knew about a fight in a bar, let alone they had seen one. And
some of these people were drinking buddies of<br>
his. Babe (Hill) doesn&#146;t remember any fight in a bar. Jim
avoided fights.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I remember the story written in <i>No One Here
Gets Out Alive</i> about you, Jim and Babe<br>
getting into a fight at Barney&#146;s Beanery.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Not true.It&#146;s not true. Danny Sugerman made it
up. Danny and Ray made it up. I add Ray, because<br>
I know that Ray was one of the people that worked on <i>No One
Here Gets Out Alive</i>, which has been<br>
renamed <i>Nothing Here But Lots Of Lies. </i>See, it&#146;s
perfect. So that&#146;s what we all call it now. That&#146;s the
real<br>
name of that book now. All of Jim&#146;s friends call it that
now.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I know a lot of fans who tend to believe every
single word of that book and violently<br>
defend their beliefs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>; You can tell them to my authority and the 30 people
I interviewed that there was not one person<br>
saying that book was any good, and although we are people who
hate book-burning, I think all of us<br>
would burn that book if we had the opportunity. So that&#146;s
why we all call it<i> Nothing Here But Lots Of Lies</i>.<br>
And the movie should have a special title, too. This movie by
Oliver Stone is nothing but the sequel to<br>
this terrible book. It portrays another person but not Jim
Morrison, just using Jim Morrison&#146;s name. Just<br>
like me making a movie about you. I name this character Rainer
Moddemann. And I tell people it&#146;s based<br>
on your life. But actually, it&#146;s a story about an Eskimo,
living in an igloo. But he has your name. Kills whales.<br>
That&#146;s how different that is. Oliver Stone was in Vietnam
when we were here. He killed people. But we<br>
were here protesting against the war. And Jim was singing <i>The
Unknown Soldier</i> on stage. Oliver was<br>
doing exactly what we were protesting against.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What would have been your favorite director for a
movie about Jim? Francis Ford Coppola?<br>
Let&#146;s say, the script would be one Jim&#146;s friends could
agree to.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Coppola? Perhaps. Yeah, it depends on the script.
One of the French directors would do this<br>
more personal. The story needs to be more personal. It
doesn&#146;t need to be big. It needs to be the story<br>
of one person struggling and fighting in this culture. In Miami
on stage he was trying to say, &#147;<i>I don&#146;t want<br>
me to be up here and you down there &#150; we should all be in
one place at the same time</i>.&#148; Jim was<br>
trying to destroy that barrier between people. He was trying to
do it in a creative kind of way. I think the<br>
story should be about an outlaw genius in American culture, an
outlaw artist genius. And I say outlaw,<br>
because Jim would never have sided with the establishment about
anything. It would be nice to see<br>
some new Jim Morrison; one with the same explosive anger and
energy that he has. Not anger so much<br>
as intensity that he had, and the same creative genius, you know,
I don&#146;t think any of the current rock stars<br>
has that. Well, I don&#146;t follow popular culture that much,
but it doesn&#146;t seem to be that there are people<br>
with that same power that Jim had. People talk about U2 and Bono
&#150; I don&#146;t see that in him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: I guess The Doors used to be a kind of ship to
carry his fantasies out to the public?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: I think in some ways at the beginning he wanted the
band to be a unit of four, like a gang.<br>
That had the potential to work together towards the common
purpose to do something creative on stage.<br>
Well, that didn&#146;t last long because he had hooked up with
three other people who were very different than<br>
he was and they had their own hidden goals. Even in the best
groups people had their own hidden goals,<br>
you know. They&#146;re not each the same. Anyway, I think after a
while he realized that he was naïve about<br>
people sometimes, too, in a sense that he actually had this
honest feeling that if you get four people<br>
together they could act as a unity for years. I think he saw the
band as a creative force at the beginning,<br>
using the music incorporating poetry and film until it became a
positive force, an experimental creative<br>
culture of its own. After a while he realized very very quickly
that these other people couldn&#146;t have this<br>
same sort of intense that he had. This doesn&#146;t mean they
didn&#146;t want the same thing but they didn&#146;t<br>
understand it. John Densmore didn&#146;t understand what Jim
intended. And when they sold the rights to<br>
<i>Light My Fire</i> to Buick they gave up on him, that&#146;s my
opinion. Without his permission. They just<br>
sold it to Buick!<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What could you tell me about The Doors in general?<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>FRANK:</strong> I&#146;m not interested in The Doors.
I&#146;m not even interested in their music. I&#146;m not
interested in<br>
any of that, I&#146;m only interested in Jim. Jim was my friend.
I&#146;m interested in Jim as a creative person,<br>
cos I think creativity, as we were talking about yesterday, is an
important element in a man&#146;s evolution,<br>
in a man&#146;s society. We have to get back to more creative
sources &#150; nature. Jim was a perfect example<br>
of someone trying to get back to that spontaneously created
nature. So I&#146;m interested in Jim as a<br>
creative person. I&#146;m interested in The Doors only in that
allowed Jim Morrison a certain amount of<br>
freedom, and then they took that freedom away from him. They did
both things. It&#146;s a very good metaphor<br>
for the fact that in our culture, the American culture,
commercialism allows you an opportunity, and then<br>
it closes the door.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: Could you please explain that more clearly?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: It closes the door because the demands of the
industry were such that he was always in<br>
growth. Without growth the band would have had to play clubs.
Perfect for Jim, because Jim didn&#146;t care<br>
about the money. He didn&#146;t care about adulation. What he
cared about was the creation, how to create<br>
something. John Densmore said on the radio in San Francisco,
&#147;<i>Jim Morrison ruined my career</i>.&#148;<br>
And I am mad at him because of this. Before he was a singer he
was a poet. Before he was a poet he<br>
did other things, other art forms. He drew, he created stories,
he made films, he was always creative.<br>
Even on stage, not through the singing but through the stage
action he created a new way of popular<br>
entertainment. His whole aspect was creation. That was his focus.
And &#150; in our culture &#150; you cannot<br>
combine the two things. Look at how many writers went to
Hollywood and left. You can&#146;t be a good<br>
writer in Hollywood. It&#146;s impossible, because it&#146;s a
contradiction. You can&#146;t be a good writer and<br>
become a part of a major supergroup. It&#146;s impossible in our
culture.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RAINER</b>: What would you say to fans who model their lives
on Jim Morrison &#150; who try to live on the<br>
edge like him?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>FRANK</b>: Most of us get a little bit frightened when we
approach that territory. And with good reason,<br>
because we don&#146;t have the equipment to go out there. We
aren&#146;t born as explorers. It&#146;s something<br>
that we&#146;ve got to train ourselves to be and to say, &#147;<i>Well,
I&#146;m going to model my life after so and so<br>
and explore&#133;&#148;</i>, is to lose side of the fact that the
person you&#146;re going to be modeling after has<br>
years of experience, has the equipment, has the back and so on.
Jim was an explorer, but he made<br>
himself that; it wasn&#146;t something that he did out of a whim
one day.<br>
