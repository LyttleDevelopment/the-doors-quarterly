        the Atlantic I booked my flight. First city I visited was
        New York. On July 12, 1993, I met Patricia

                believe he<br>
                left for Paris on the 10</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
                of March, 1971. I was with him in L.A.for a week
                or so. At the time I was staying with<br>
                him he did tell me he was going over to Paris
                with Pam and it was basically to end the
                relationship. He said they<br>
                had been together on and off for a number of
                years, but that basically that he was ending it.
                He felt that he owed<br>
                her this because she was completely dependent on
                him. She had no resources of her own and could
                basically do<br>
                nothing for herself. He felt he owed it to her to
                end it that way. He also made it clear he
                intended to come back<br>
                to me in the fall after he ended this, broke it
                off with Pam. In fact I was getting this
                information in letters from<br>
                him through April, May and June. I was hearing
                from him on a more or less regular basis by mail
                and in the<br>
                letters he made it quite clear. I was not the
                only person hearing this sort of thing from him
                at that time. Max Fink<br>
                was getting letters from him to the effect that
                he wanted to be home before the 4</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup><strong>
                of July and all of a sudden he&#146;s<br>
                dead on the 3</strong><sup><strong>rd</strong></sup><strong>
                of July. I think to me and maybe to other people
                as well, it was very suspicious to say the least.</strong></font></td>

                certainly appears as if she was responsible for
                giving him the heroin that killed him. He was not
                a heroin addict.<br>
                I want you to know. I want to make it very, very
                clear to people that if it was heroin that killed
                him, it was<br>
                probably the first time he ever tried it and it
                would kind of tie into the fact that he was very
                down and depressed.<br>
                It could be something as simple as Pam out of her
                own guilt and being a heroin addict saying,
                &#147;Try this. It will<br>
                make you feel better&#148;, or maybe concurrently
                telling him to snort it up. Maybe telling him it
                was cocaine. But in<br>
                any case, she was responsible for giving it to
                him. If she didn&#146;t actually fire the gun as
                it were, she was the one<br>
                who put the bullets into the chamber and held it
                out to him. He would have never gotten heroin at

                Misérable,<br>
                as they say in French. Just raised dirt. I met a
                fan at the grave who was very, very kind.
                Pathetic to me. He said<br>
                he could outline the grave in white scallop
                shells, which I thought was lovely and they
                actually made a cross for<br>
                him which they wrote his name along with
                'artiste, poète and compositeur' in French and
                asked me if I would write<br>
                in the dates of his birth and death, which of
                course I was quite moved to do. I thought it was
                wonderful that people<br>
                who didn&#146;t even know him would do more for
                him in death than the people who claimed to be
                his friends who buried<br>
                him. Whoever that person was, I never found out
                his name. I want to thank him forever for that.</strong></font></td>

                He did say he went to Paris to find peace. I don&#146;t
                think that eternal peace is what he had in mind,
                but<br>
                unfortunately that&#146;s the way it turned out.
                I believe he was beginning to come to terms with
                his own very real<br>
                problems. His alcoholism, his troubled past. All
                of this was being put behind him, which was the
                whole idea of<br>
                going to Paris. Pamela as well. Put all that
                behind and to start again. Not that he&#146;d
                made a full step by getting<br>
                involved with The Doors albums because he loved
                music and he loved playing with the band and I
                think that<br>
                would have always continued to a certain extent -
                being involved with music. There were other
                things he<br>
                wanted to get into and in that sense, he saw
                Paris as a first step - to being involved in
                that, to leaving the past<br>
                behind 'Jim Morrison of The Doors' and going onto
                these other things and it&#146;s just a great
                tragedy all of that<br>
                was taken away from him by someone that claimed
                to care for him.</strong></font></td>
