        size="3" face="Calibri">The Doors Quarterly Magazine #26,
        with its stunning cover photo by Frank Lisciandro,<br>
        went to the post office on May 20, 1992 (I was NOT happy
        at all with the quality of<br>
        the printing). It had but one page of news ... not much
        compared to all following<br>
        editions of the Quarterly. Nothing much had been going on
        the months before, but as<br>
        usual our readers were provided with some interesting
        articles which were absolutely<br>
        worth reading.<br>
        <br>
        There&#146;s part four on my <i>L.A. Guide</i>, leading
        fans to Laurel Canyon, to the former<br>
        Morrison Hotel and the original Hard Rock Café, down
        south to Santa Monica and<br>
        the former Turkey Joint West (I remember some great beers
        in there) and I also<br>
        added a few updates of information on previous parts of
        the guide.<br>
        <br>
        Two book reviews (Kennealy-Morrison and
        Riordan/Prochnicky) and eleven reviews<br>
        of underground CDs and LPs informed fans about
        interesting but also to-be-avoided<br>
        purchases.<br>
        <br>
        Most interesting in issue #26 was a 3-page story by my
        friend Cathy Weldy, who<br>
        used to know The Doors and especially Jim from 1966 to
        the months before he left<br>
        for Paris. Cathy wrote this very touching report
        exclusively for The Doors Quarterly<br>
        Magazine. Another retrospective view of The Doors at the
        Avalon 1967 was written by<br>
        Sally E. Hinton. A further article by Jeff Hughson who
        remembers his experiences of<br>
        watching a few Doors concerts in 1967.<br>
        <br>
        In addition I put in Cris Reabur&#146;s <i>Morrison Hotel
        Revisited</i>, one of the most interesting<br>
        reviews ever written. An interesting Q&amp;A by Jerry
        Hopkins about his forthcoming book<br>
        <i>The Lizard King</i> is followed by Doug
        Sundling&#146;s essay <i>Their Artistic Vision</i> (this
        later<br>
        became the title of Sundling&#146;s book) and a shorter
        essay by Dan Salomon called <i>Vision<br>
        of Los Angeles</i>. And finally a brilliant <i>Journey to
        the Vortex of the Golden Scarab</i> from<br>
        Downbeat (November 1974) made a good read in this issue
        of The Doors Quarterly<br>
        Magazine #26. For a change, sadly there wasn&#146;t any
        free poster with it.<br>

        your digital copy of The Doors Quarterly Magazine #26
        hasn't been<br>
        altered in any way. You get it as it was published on May

        without the internet.<br>
